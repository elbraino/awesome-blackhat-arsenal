    "description": "The core idea of AiCEF, is to harness the intelligence that is available from online and MISP reports, as well as threat groups' activities, arsenal etc., from, e.g., MITRE, to create relevant and timely cybersecurity exercises. To this end, we have developed a specialised ontology called Cyber Exercise Scenario Ontology (CESO), which extends STIX [2]. The core idea is to map reports; both from online resources and MISP, via a common ontology to graphs. This way, we abstract the events from the reports in a machine-readable form. The produced graphs can be infused with additional intelligence, e.g. the threat actor profile from MITRE, also mapped in our ontology. While this may fill gaps that would be missing from a report, one can also manipulate the graph to create custom and unique models. Finally, we exploit transformer-based language models like GPT to convert the graph into text that can serve as the scenario of a cybersecurity exercise.\nWe have tested and validated AiCEF with a group of experts in cybersecurity exercises, and the results clearly show that AiCEF significantly augments the capabilities in creating timely and relevant cybersecurity exercises in terms of both quality and time.",

    "description": "MemTracer is a tool that offers live memory analysis capabilities, allowing digital forensic practitioners to discover and investigate stealthy attack traces hidden in memory.\nAdvanced persistence threat (APT) adversaries use stealthy attack tactics that only leave volatile short-lived memory evidence. The reflective Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) load technique is considered one of the stealthiest attack techniques. Reflective DLL load allows adversaries to load malicious code directly into memory, rather than loading a file from the disk. Thus, reflective\nDLL load leaves no digital evidence present on the disk. The malicious DLL continues to execute as long as the compromised process is running. Terminating a compromised process leads to the removal of the malicious DLL from memory, and the release of the memory region back to the pool for reallocation. Therefore, memory needs to be examined periodically in order to detect the existence of a malicious DLL that loaded reflectively into memory.\nLoading DLL reflectively produces an unusual memory region's characteristics that can indicate its existence. The MemTracer tool was developed to efficiently scan memory regions to detect reflective DLL loading symptoms. Mainly, MemTracer aims to detect native .NET framework DLLs that are loaded reflectively. Additionally, MemTracer provides the ability to search for a specific loaded DLL by name, which can retrieve the list of processes that have abnormally loaded the specified module for further investigation.",

    "description": "Over the last 10 years, many threat groups have employed stegomalware or other steganography-based techniques to attack organizations from all sectors and in all regions of the world. Some examples are: APT15/Vixen Panda, APT23/Tropic Trooper, APT29/Cozy Bear, APT32/OceanLotus, APT34/OilRig, APT37/ScarCruft, APT38/Lazarus Group, Duqu Group, Turla, Vawtrack, Powload, Lokibot, Ursnif, IceID, etc.Our research shows that most groups are employing very simple techniques (at least from an academic perspective) and known tools to circumvent perimeter defenses, although more advanced groups are also using steganography to hide C&C communication and data exfiltration. We argue that this lack of sophistication is not due to the lack of knowledge in steganography (some APTs have already experimented with advanced algorithms) but simply because organizations are not able to defend themselves, even against the simplest steganography techniques.\n\nDuring the demonstration we will show the practical limitations of applying existing automated steganalysis techniques for companies that want to prevent infections or information theft by these threat actors. For this reason, we have created stegoWiper, a tool to blindly disrupt any image-based stegomalware, attacking the weakest point of all steganography algorithms: their robustness. We'll show that it is capable of disrupting all steganography techniques and tools (Invoke-PSImage, F5, Steghide, openstego, ...) employed nowadays. In fact, the more sophisticated a steganography technique is, the more disruption stegoWiper produces. Moreover, our active attack allows us to disrupt any steganography payload from all the images exchanged by an organization by means of a web proxy ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) service, in real time and without having to identify which images contain hidden data first.\n\nAfter our presentation at BlackHat USA 2022 Arsenal we have been working on supporting, disrupting, state-of-the-art advanced algorithms available in the academic literature, based on matrix encryption, wet-papers, etc. (e.g. Hill, J-Uniward, Hugo). Especially we have paid attention to the YASS algorithm (https://pboueke.github.io/CryptoStego/) resistant to numerous active attacks and commercial CDR-type software.

    "description": "Previously, we introduced N3XT G3N WAF (NGWAF) 1.0 at BHUSA 2022. The novel WAF 3.0 tool that seeks to relieve complex and difficult WAF detection mechanism with detection utilising a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) and traps attackers through a custom honeypotted environment. These assets are all dockerised for scalability.\n\nHowever, further experiments have proven that a SNN may not be the most optimal when it comes down to contextualised defence as it processes information in a step by step and sequential manner. It gets relatively cumbersome and ineffective detecting chained or contexualised attacks. Both of which are extremely common in today's attacks.\n\nThus, we took another approach by swapping out our \"brains\". We revamped the SNN and went with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is a much better choice for contextualised defense as the output of each layer is fed back as the input of the same layer. Thus, this allows the network to maintain a \"memory\" of the data it has processed. Our latest model is a RNN with a bi-directional LSTM module, it has an accuracy of 0.995 and a f1 score of 0.993.\n\nWe have also upgraded NGWAF's scalability in model deployment, model maintenance and the overall detection pipeline. This is all done with cloudifying the operations of the entire Machine Learning detection module. As compared to version 1.0 where users have to install and run the entire framework on their local system, NGWAF 2.0 has employed Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts, which auto-deploys the machine learning model's training & maintenance pipeline onto AWS resources (Sagemaker). The detection module has also been shifted from local deployment to AWS Sagemaker where we are able to standardise the hardware utilised for the ML model. This also allows further decoupling of the detection module from the rest of the system and allow for greater customisability.\n\nBHUSA 2022 - Version 01: (https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/arsenal/schedule/index.html#nxt-gn-waf-ml-based-waf-with-retraining-and-detainment-through-honeypots-26609)",

With this tool, we can grasp the possibility of infection to other devices and the progress of attack using ATT&CK and statistical methods based on the Sysmon log.\nFurthermore, this tool automatically converts aggregated Sysmon logs into ATT&CK Technique using Atomic Red Team's library. The converted information is visualized in a list format or colored in the ATT&CK Matrix.\nIt is beneficial when significant and chaotic logs can be transformed into a clear cybersecurity knowledge base format in a few moments. The tool is also helpful for real-world anomaly detection and cybersecurity learning.\nWe will provide this tool as a Web application and publish its source code on GitHub.",

It's been adopted by many notorious groups such as BlackCat Ransomware, Play Ransomware and more. Altogether, the groups using intermittent encryption have successfully targeted hundreds of organizations in 2022 alone. However, even though intermittent encryption has its advantages, it leaves much of the content of targeted files unencrypted. In this talk, we will demonstrate a tool that uses this limitation to recover valuable data, such as text and images from documents encrypted by these groups, allowing the victims to recover some of their lost data.",

The malware comes in all shapes and forms, ranging from skiddish stealers all the way to nation state backed targeted malware. The underground market, along with public open-source tools, provide a plethora of ways to obfuscate and pack the malware. Unpacking malware is time consuming, difficult, and tedious, which poses a problem.\n\nTo counter this, DotDumper automatically dumps interesting artifacts during the malware's execution, ranging from base64 decoded values to decrypted PE files. As such, the malware decrypts and executes the next stage, while DotDumper conveniently provides a copy of said decrypted stage. All this is done via a simple, compact, intuitive, and easy-to-use command-line interface.\n\nAside from the dumped artifacts, DotDumper provides an extensive log of the traced execution, based on managed hooks. For each hook, the log contains the original function name, arguments and their values, and the return value. Since DotDumper ensures that the original function is called, the malware's execution continues as if it was executed normally, allowing the analyst to get as many stages from the sample as possible.\n\nDotDumper can execute DotNet Framework executables, as well as dynamic link libraries, due to the fully-fledged reflective loader which is embedded. Any given function can be selected within a library, along with any required variables and their values, all easily accessible from DotDumper's command-line interface.\n\nDotDumper has proven to be effective in dealing with the renowned AgentTesla stealer or the WhisperGate Wiper loader, allowing an analyst to easily fetch the decrypted and unpacked in-memory only stages, thus decreasing up the time spent on unpacking, allowing for faster response to the given threat.",

However, it will take a lot of time to detect cyber-attacks if SOC analysts do not have clues. Conventional log analysis tools such as SIEM can detect attacks but cannot predict the next attack from the information already obtained. Recommendation systems often used in e-commerce sites can predict future purchasing behavior by analyzing the user's purchase history. Replacing with ATT&CK, each attacker group can be considered a user, and techniques attackers use can be regarded as a user's purchase history.\nUsing this tool, the logs are mapped to ATT&CK techniques by uploading log files to create a technique usage history of the attacker (adversary) currently conducting an ongoing attack. The adversary's technique usage history and past APT attack data are used for collaborative filtering to predict which techniques the adversary may use in the future. This visualization is\u3000displayed together with the ATT&CK tactic, enabling you to see the attack flow in stages of progression. In addition, search queries of SIEM associated with forecasted ATT&CK technique are outputted. SOC analysts can consider attacks quickly and comprehensively by using queries.\nThe source code of this tool and an example analysis will be shown on GitHub. It is available as a web application.",

    "description": "Remove-Signature is a tool designed to automate the process of generating a payload that can bypass anti-virus detection.\n\nDuring red team testing, red team operators often need to prepare a payload that will not be detected by anti-virus software in order to be successful. One way to do this is to identify where the signatures used by anti-virus software are located in the payload, and then modifies bytes of the locations so that the modified payload will not be detected as malicious. This process can be time-consuming.\n\nRemove-Signature aims to automate this process by identifying the signatures in the payload, and modifying a single byte of the signatures location in a way that will bypass anti-virus detection, while still maintaining the functionality of the payload. The tool understands the PE file format and only makes modifications that will not affect the payload's functionality. Unlike other existing tools that can only identify signatures, Remove-Signature is able to automatically generate a modified payload that can evade anti-virus detection.\n\nThe use of Remove-Signature can help to reduce the workload of red team operators and allow them to focus on other aspects of the red team engagement.",

It is the only open-source project that has achieved any Center for Internet Security (CIS) certification.\n\nKICS is fully customizable and extensible by the addition of rules for new vulnerabilities. It is available as a Docker image, and is paired in multiple platforms to leverage its integration on the development life-cycle and the DevSecOps mentality of its users. Gitlab has chosen KICS as its default IaC scanner; it is also available in ArgoHub, as a hook in TerraformCloud or as a Github Action for Github workflows.\n\nOne of the most recent features of KICS is auto remediation. With this feature KICS goes full cycle in preventing vulnerable code from going into production by scanning the code, exposing the issues, and automatically remediating them. Such a feature is both available from the CLI interface, or via a plugin for the Visual Studio Code editor, where we bring together auto-remediation and real-time scanning. As the developer writes IaC scripts, KICS automatically looks for vulnerabilities, proposes fixes and remediates them. By the time the IaC scripts are finished, developers are rest assured that it is safe to go into production. This is shift-left security brought to its splendor.",

Also, the framework supports different use cases: single organization-multiple areas, multiple organization-single area, and multiple organization-multiple areas. It has been successfully tested in exercises with international companies, which allowed us to validate its commercial level.\n\nTabletop exercises have 2 approaches: traditional (scenarios with discussion) and modern (automatic events on a platform). The 1st platform was funded by the DHS (USA) with USD20 MM over 10 years. In 2021 we proposed a novel approach using free platforms, which allowed the development of a free and open source framework.\n\nThe original research paper presented and published at the IEEE ARGENCON 2022 academic congress, under the title \"Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulation for Organizational and Classroom Learning.\" Preprint available at IEEE TechRxiv: https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Cybersecurity_incident_response_tabletop_simulations_for_learning_in_classrooms_and_organizations/20317416/1/files/36346944.pdf\n\nThe tool itself was first presented an released in the most important cybersecurity conference in Spain in (RootedCon 2022) and then updated and presented in the most important cybersecurity conference in Latin America (Ekoparty 2022).

This turns unblob into the perfect companion for extracting, analyzing, and reverse engineering firmware images.\n\nSimilar to what HD Moore did 19 years ago when he started gathering exploit scripts in a single unifying framework with Metasploit, we'd like to provide reverse engineers with an easy to use and extensible framework to extract custom formats. Our hope is to provide a home to firmware reversers and help them not rewriting the same code every time they need to support a new vendor format.",
