# 🧩 Contributing to Awesome Black Hat Arsenal

We’re excited to have you contribute to this curated archive of cybersecurity tools from Black Hat Arsenal events. This guide explains how to add tools properly so they are auto-integrated into the list.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **location** and **year**. Each tool is placed in a specific folder based on these two criteria.

```

tools/
├── USA/
│   ├── 2023/
│   │   ├── toolname.json
│   │   └── README.md
├── Europe/
│   └── 2024/
│       └── toolname.json

````

- Tools are grouped by **location** (`USA`, `Europe`, `Asia`, etc.).
- Then, tools are categorized by **year** of the Black Hat event.
- Each tool is added as a `.json` file within its respective year folder.

---

## 🧠 Tool JSON Format

Each `.json` file should contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "Tool Name": "Cool Exploit Framework",
  "Description": "A modular post-exploitation tool for cloud environments.",
  "Github URL": "https://github.com/username/tool",
  "Tracks": ["Track: Exploitation and Ethical Hacking"],
  "Speakers": ["Jane Doe"]
}
````

### Required Fields:

* `Tool Name`: The name of the tool.
* `Description`: 1–3 sentence description (avoid marketing fluff).
* `Tracks`: List of applicable track names (e.g., `"Track: Reverse Engineering"`).
* `Speakers`: Name(s) of the presenters (can be multiple).
* `Github URL`: Link to the tool's GitHub repository or official page (if public).

---

## ✅ Track Names

Use one or more of the following **valid track names** (exact spelling, no `Track:` prefix):

* Exploitation and Ethical Hacking
* Vulnerability Assessment
* Web AppSec
* Code Assessment
* Network Attacks
* Network Defense
* Malware Offense
* Malware Defense
* Reverse Engineering
* Data Forensics/Incident Response
* OSINT - Open Source Intelligence
* Android, iOS and Mobile Hacking
* Hardware/Embedded
* Internet Of Things
* Smart Grid/Industrial Security
* Cloud Security
* AI, ML & Data Science
* Cryptography
* Human Factors
* Arsenal Lab

If a tool doesn’t fit into any of these tracks, simply omit the `Tracks` field, and it will be placed in the `Others` section.

---

## 🧪 Validation

Once you add a JSON file:

* **Validate the JSON format**: Ensure that the file opens without errors in a JSON linter.
* **README generation**: Run `python3 AutoReadme.py` from the repo root to regenerate the README files, and commit the result (or submit a PR, and we’ll handle it for you).
