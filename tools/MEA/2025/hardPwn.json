  "Tool Name": "HardPwn",
  "Description": "HardPwn is a purpose-built hardware exploitation platform crafted for intermediate and advanced hardware hackers who want to push embedded devices, PCBs, and IoT gadgets to their limits. The toolkit elevates low-level hardware reconnaissance by automatically probing SPI, UART, I2C, and JTAG interfaces, performing chip-level reconnaissance where possible, executing NAND glitching on non-BGA chips, and dumping firmware—all with minimal setup. By automating over 90% of typical test cases, HardPwn transforms what traditionally takes months of manual exploration into a matter of hours.",
