  "Tool Name": "SkyEye",
  "Description": "SkyEye is the first Cooperative Multi-Principal IAM Enumeration Framework for AWS Cloud, featuring two novel models: CPIEM and TCREM. Unlike conventional IAM tools, SkyEye synchronizes reconnaissance across multiple user and role sessions, dynamically chaining and merging their vantage points to map the full spectrum of permissions, resource authorizations, and hidden escalation paths. It reveals what principals can achieve in combination, uncovering privilege escalation vectors invisible to traditional single-principal IAM enumeration.",
