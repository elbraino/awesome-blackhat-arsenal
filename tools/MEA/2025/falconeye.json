  "Tool Name": "FalconEye",
  "Description": "FalconEye is an AI-powered security code analyzer that uses locally hosted LLMs via Ollama for semantic vulnerability detection. Unlike traditional SAST tools that rely on pattern matching, FalconEye employs multi-agent collaboration to build dynamic knowledge graphs, form hypotheses, and conduct targeted investigations across codebases. It supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C/C++, Java, and more. Its privacy-first design ensures all analysis stays local, and it accumulates knowledge across sessions for progressively deeper audits.",
