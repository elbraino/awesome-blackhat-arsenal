  "Tool Name": "IPTI",
  "Description": "Every device connected to the internet is inherently tied to an IP address— a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device within a computer network. In real-world scenarios, especially during product development, integration with third-party services often requires IP whitelisting to allow access to internal systems. However, this practice introduces security risks, making it imperative for security engineers to audit and validate the IP address reputation beforehand.While several trusted threat intelligence platforms such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault, and ThreatBook provide IP reputation services, relying on a single source is often insufficient due to inconsistent or outdated data. To overcome these limitations, IPTI – IP Threat Intelligence Tool was developed. IPTI aggregates reputation data from multiple reputable sources and enriches the analysis with additional context such as open port detection, server metadata, privacy indicators, and PTR record evaluation. These insights are then synthesized into a comprehensive risk-based scoring system, providing a more accurate and actionable assessment. IPTI is designed to be a practical and customizable tool to support security engineers in network access control and threat validation.",
