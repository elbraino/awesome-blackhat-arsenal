## AI-Augmented Security
<details><summary><strong>AI-Augmented Incident Response</strong></summary>

![MEA 2025](https://img.shields.io/badge/MEA%202025-orange) ![Category: AI-Augmented Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20AI-Augmented%20Security-blue) ![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** AI-powered workflows to accelerate detection, triage, and response during security incidents. This tool leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze security alerts, correlate events, and suggest response actions, significantly reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) in complex security operations.

🔗 **Link:** [SAIST](https://github.com/punk-security/saist)  
📝 **Description:** SAIST (Static AI-powered Scanning Tool) is an open-source project that scans codebases for vulnerabilities using AI. It supports multiple LLMs, and can scan full codebases, diffs between commits, or even GitHub PRs automatically. The common use cases are: Scan an entire application's code base with your favourite LLM (OpenAI, Deepseek etc) and get a PDF report, Scan a code change and comment on a pull request. SAIST allows you to control which LLM is used, such as AWS bedrock or Azure OpenAI.
