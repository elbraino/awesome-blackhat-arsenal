  "Tool Name": "AI-augmented incident response",
  "Description": "A hands-on Arsenal Lab CTF on a live AWS EKS environment where participants use an AI investigation agent backed by MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool servers to perform incident response. The agent triages Falco runtime detections, correlates Kubernetes audit events, maps AWS-side activity, and reconstructs attack paths across a simulated intrusion (port scanning, vulnerability exploitation, lateral movement, data exfiltration). The tool stack includes Falco with K8s Audit and AWS plugins, Wazuh for host monitoring, Trivy for image scanning, kube-bench for CIS benchmarks, and curated CloudTrail/VPC Flow Logs.",
