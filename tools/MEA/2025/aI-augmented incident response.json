  "Tool Name": "AI-augmented incident response",
  "Description": "Security teams drown in signals while attacks move across cloud infrastructure. This hands-on Arsenal Lab turns that reality into a capture-the-flag challenge on a live AWS environmentrunning Amazon EKS. Participants will use an AI investigation agent - backed by Multiple MCP(Model Context Protocol) tool servers to triage Falco runtime detections, correlate Kubernetesaudit events, map AWS-side activity, and reconstruct the attack path. The CTF simulates arealistic intrusion (Ports scanning -> vulnerability/misconfiguration exploit -> lateral movement ->data exfil), and the agent guides each step by orchestrating queries against the tool stack,explaining reasoning, and generating next-best actions. Falco on EKS with K8s Audit & AWS plugins (runtime + control-plane signals). ● Wazuh for host/VM monitoring and posture checks. ● Supplemental: Trivy (image scan), kube-bench (CIS), OPA/Gatekeeper policies (posture), and curated CloudTrail/VPC Flow Logs for enrichment. ● AI Agent with MCP servers (read-only) exposing: k8s API views, Falco feed, Wazuh events, CloudTrail search, S3/object metadata, and CTF state. All tool calls are logged and rate-limited.",
