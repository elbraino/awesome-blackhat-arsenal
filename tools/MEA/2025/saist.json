  "Tool Name": "SAIST",
  "Description": "SAIST (Static AI-powered Scanning Tool) is an open-source vulnerability scanner that uses AI to analyze codebases. It supports multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Deepseek, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI) and can scan full codebases, diffs between commits, or GitHub PRs automatically. Key workflows include scanning an entire application to generate a PDF vulnerability report, and commenting directly on pull requests with findings. Users control which LLM backend is used, maintaining data sovereignty while leveraging AI-powered code analysis.",
