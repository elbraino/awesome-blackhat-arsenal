  "Description": "FTW is designed to be a comprehensive test suite to help provide rigorous tests for WAF rules. It uses the OWASP Core Ruleset V3 as a baseline to test rules on for various WAFs. It is designed to:\n\nFind regressions in WAF deployments by using continuous integration and issuing repeatable attacks against a WAF\nProvide a testing framework for new rules into the Core Rule Set, if a rule is submitted it MUST have corresponding positive & negative tests\nEvaluate WAFs against a common, agreeable baseline ruleset (OWASP)\nTest and verify custom rules for WAFs that are not leveraging the core rule set",
