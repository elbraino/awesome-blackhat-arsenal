  "Description": "There is a lack of tools for testing the security of Cloud deployments; the Cumulus Toolkit is an attack framework for exploiting the Cloud's weak points.\n\nThe Cloud enables software projects to speed up development because it allows developers to provision infrastructure and make configuration changes to their networks without much friction. This ease of deployment was but a dream in the age of the traditional datacenter. However, the Cloud also brings new attack surface which needs further exploration. Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) services (such as Amazon's) are primary targets for attackers, as these typically control access to hundreds of API calls over many services.\n\nOver the years there have been various discussions around cloud security, e.g., Pivoting in Amazon Clouds (2013), and few tools have been developed to enable testing the security of Cloud deployments. These tools are standalone, have not attained wide adoption, and/or have not made it into widely adopted toolkits. To fill this void, we have developed the Cumulus Toolkit. The Cumulus Toolkit is a Cloud exploitation toolkit based on the Metasploit Framework. We chose Metasploit because of its wide adoption and its wealth of existing features.\n\nThe Cumulus toolkit is a set of modules that can be used perform privilege escalation, account takeover, and to launch unauthorized workloads. To illustrate security concerns resulting from lax IAM policies, we present the Create IAM User module which can be used to create a user with administrative privileges. To perform complete account takeover, an attack that we've seen in the wild, we present the User Locker module which is used to lock out all legitimate users out of the account. Finally, we present the Launch Instances module which can be used to launch Cloud hosts on demand.",
