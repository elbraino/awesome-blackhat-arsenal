  "Description": "Rattler is a tool that automates the identification of DLL's which can be used for DLL preloading attacks on Windows 7/8.1/10. The automation of such a process significantly decreases the amount of time required to identify vulnerable and exploitable DLL's.\n\nFor example, if an application were to have ~100 DLL's and if it took ~2 minutes to test each DLL, that is ~2 hours for a single application to be tested using a manual process. Additionally, the process for testing an application for DLL preloading vulnerabilities is rather simple and can be automated trivially using some C++, Windows API calls and fresh beard oil , hence Rattler.\n\nThe identification of vulnerable DLL's can assist in an attacker in achieving code execution or escalation of privileges.",
