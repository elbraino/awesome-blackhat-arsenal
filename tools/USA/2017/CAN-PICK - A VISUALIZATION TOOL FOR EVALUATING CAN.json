  "Description": "With the development of automotive technology, vehicles become more electronic and intelligent on the basis of inner bus communication network, and they draw more attention to the study of automotive cybersecurity. To facilitate this process, we developed a tool that evaluates the cybersecurity of the CAN-bus, which can be used for black-box tests by security researchers and automotive engineers.\n\nThis tool is capable of sniffing CAN-bus packets, analyzing UDS, as well as launching fuzzing attacks, and brute-force attacks. Fuzzing attack has two modes; we can combine id with data or single one to fuzz CAN-bus packet. By visualizing the changes from different packets, it can help us to identify id and value range related with function quickly. And we can easily find out which data is encrypted, so that it\u2019ll more convenient to guess encrypt algorithm. Users can also share their programmable examples within the tool. This talk will introduce the reverse engineering of CAN-bus and present the \"CAN-Pick\" tool by demonstrations of injecting CAN-bus packets on a car. We will show some videos to prove the results of our work. This tool can also be used as a remote access tool, which can realize full control over the car without adding any actuators on the vehicle in some modern car via Telematics system.",
