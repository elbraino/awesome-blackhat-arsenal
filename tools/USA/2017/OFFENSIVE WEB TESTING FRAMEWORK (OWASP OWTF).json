  "Description": "OWASP OWTF is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency and alignment of security tests to security standards like the OWASP Testing Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST so that pentesters will have more time to:\n\nSee the big picture and think out of the box\nMore efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities\nHave time to investigate complex vulnerabilities like business logic/architectural flaws, etc.\nPerform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas\nDemonstrate true impact despite the short timeframes we are typically given to test\n\nThe tool is highly configurable and anybody can trivially create simple plugins or add new tests in the configuration files without having any development experience. OWTF includes\n\nA highly configurable plugin system\nA fast (the fastest Python MiTM proxy yet!) MiTM SSL proxy\nA pretty web interface\nAn interactive report\nFull coverage for OWASP Testing Guide v3/v4, PTES, NIST, and CWE mappings\nBuilt-in integrations for Mozilla Zest and Plug-n-Hack standards\nREST API exposed to control and extend the functionality of OWTF\n\nThis release will see new completely revamped web interface, code refactoring, and much easier installation process. OWTF is expected to undergo an extensive change to add features like distributed architecture, proxy transaction modification/replay, plugin chaining, and much more for the new 2.1 release in the summer. The OWTF project, started in 2011, has grown into a community for tools like HTTP request translator, tool health monitor, Pentester's Tools Parser (PTP), and WafBypasser. OWTF has participated in Google Summer of Code 2013, 2014, and 2016. In addition to this, it was voted as 10th and 7th most popular tool in 2015 and 2014 respectively (Toolswatch Hackers Arsenal).",
