  "Description": "Imagine\u2026 You realize that a malicious threat actor has compromised your network and is currently going through your confidential information. Faced with this dreadful scenario, you initiate an Incident Response.\n\nWe have built an agentless open source Incident Response framework based on PowerShell, called \"No Agent Hunting\" (NOAH), to help security investigation responders to gather a vast number of key artifacts without installing any agent on the endpoints saving precious time.\n\nOur goal is to provide a community-driven scalable platform allowing Incident Response teams across the world to efficiently hunt from the get-go of an incident without having the need to develop ad hoc tools or waste time installing an agent on every endpoint when the incident occurs. We aim to present complex artifact data in an understandable format allowing investigators to respond as quickly as possible.\n\nAt a time when the malicious threat actors could have breached your network in multiple ways and left backdoors in the most inconspicuous locations, how fast would you want him found when every second counts?",
