  "Description": "Security Testing, or for that matter any sort of testing, is still being done in ways that are not really scalable and extensible. Testers like to write their own tools/scripts and run them locally on their system. There are many problems that plague this kind of approach for testing.\n\nWe will be discussing some of these problems and releasing a new tool - KubeBot - that was primarily built for automating and scaling bug bounties i.e. something that would run multiple tools on a schedule against multiple targets and only returns back the output from these tools if the output changes.\n\nHowever, over time, it has proven out to be a more generic framework that can be leveraged as a harness to run any security testing tool and is easily scaleable (because of Kubernetes in the backend). It is extensible and provides a nice front end in the form of a Slackbot so that you can look at the results on a real-time basis.\n\nTool URL: \ufeffhttps://github.com/anshumanbh/kubebot",
