  "Description": "PKE (passive keyless entry) system allows the driver to unlock cars without taking out their key fob - just by being in the proximity of the vehicle or by touching the door handle. PKE systems use both low frequency and high frequency radio links to perform two-way authentication. We have implemented a relay attack using two very low-cost radios and have extended the range further than any previous research. We have already extended the attack range to a few hundred meters and can unlock your car in the parking lot while your key fob is in your pocket - on the top floor of your office building - or drive your car away while you are shopping in the mall.",
