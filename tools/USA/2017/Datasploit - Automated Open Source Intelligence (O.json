  "Description": "Utilizing various Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools and techniques that we have found to be effective, DataSploit brings them all into one place, correlates the raw data captured and gives the user, all the relevant information about the domain/email/ phone number/person, etc. It allows you to collect relevant information about a target which can expand your attack/defense surface very quickly. Sometimes it might even pluck the low hanging fruits for you without even touching the target and give you quick wins.\n\nNew release also includes ACTIVE modules which allow to use information collected from OSINT and use it for active exploitation either directly or by integrating with other Social Engineering / Pen-testing tools.",
