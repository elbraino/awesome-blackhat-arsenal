  "Description": "SERPICO is a simple and intuitive report generation and collaboration tool; the primary function is to cut down on the amount of time it takes to write a penetration testing report. Serpico was built by penetration testers with a pen-testers methodology in mind. Our goal is to save you time and improve your reporting process.\n\nWe are excited to be back at Arsenal!! We have a large release of Serpico planned with some exciting features to show off including plug-ins to simplify your life, more reports to choose from, shiny UI improvements, and better scoring. It might make you hate report writing just a little bit less.",
