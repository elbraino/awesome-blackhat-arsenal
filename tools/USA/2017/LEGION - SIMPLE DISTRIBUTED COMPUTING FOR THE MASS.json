  "Description": "At its core, Legion is a distributed computing application. It is written in python and designed from the ground up to fulfill various IT related needs. Whether you need a way to logically distribute large or complex commands across multiple systems, or if you need a way to remotely administer 1 or more other systems, Legion can help. Legion goes beyond a typical Master/Manager/Slave architecture and makes use of a MeshNetworking approach to help to dynamically route around failed nodes and networking issues. Additionally, it has the ability to allow remote shell access to any node as well as send individual commands to 1 or all of the nodes within the mesh. And of course all the communications are encrypted between the nodes. If you want to learn more or just want to see the demo, please stop by.",
