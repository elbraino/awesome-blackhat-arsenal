  "Description": "Currently, there are some research works on vehicle cybersecurity testing. Many of them are open-source projects, such as CANTact and GoodThopter. CANTact is a popular open-source toolkit available for purchase online that uses SocketCAN to communicate with a CAN bus. Since SocketCAN extends the Berkeley sockets API in Linux by introducing a new protocol family, it is easy to write script languages for CAN message injections. Python is one of the most widely-used script languages for SocketCAN programming. GoodThopter is another recent device targeted at hackers and hobbyists, but is not ready for use as a turn-key solution.\n\nThe drawbacks of these open-source tools are that they are not stable and do not work well under heavy-traffic testing scenarios. Also, open-source contributions may not meet the rigorous control and validation requirements of auto industry software practices. We found that it was possible to crash or lock up such tools when injecting them with bursty CAN traffic. For example, CANTact has limited buffer size which may cause buffer overflows. GoodThopter's timeout parameters and configuration file make it hard to work. In our case, we used the serial port for communications and Java as the programming language. Java is preferred over Python as it is faster, more stable, requires strict coding rules, and is better suited to remote control applications.\n\nCybersecurity testing focuses on finding and identifying unwanted weaknesses or vulnerabilities hiding inside vehicle software. Our goal is to develop an automated and black-box testing tool for OEMs and tier providers to test their vehicles or ECUs with consistent results, which requires no prior detailed knowledge of the testing workflow.\n\nAutomation means the tester only needs to follow pre-defined test scenarios one-by-one to finish the whole testing process. Even if the tester does not have prior security testing knowledge or background, he or she can still operate the test device and detect security vulnerabilities by following the automated steps.\n\nBlack-box testing strategies should have no prior knowledge of system commands, CAN bus command databases, or the specific manufacturer's practices within the vehicle or system under testing protocols. In this way, OEMs may feel more comfortable with black-box testing since they don't need to release too much of what they may consider to be proprietary system information to internal, outside, or third-party testers.\n\nWe have developed the automated automotive cybersecurity testing tool (named VT Auto-X) which has successfully detected serious security vulnerabilities in a number of production vehicles, and has helped several OEMs identify and correct these issues before they became expensive and embarrassing recall programs. It is a black-box test with no prior knowledge of vehicle CAN bus information. Live demonstrations of Auto-X have proven its ability to quickly find software and security vulnerabilities in most of the cars tested.\n\nAuto-X is portable, and can easily connect to a vehicle's CAN bus. The device has a panel which has various types of connection interfaces, including OBD (SAE J1979/J1962) ports and multiple CAN High and CAN Low ports. It incorporates standard banana sockets to facilitate connecting to various vehicle CAN bus accessible points, as well as several power supply options for testing flexibility (bench, garage, mobile). Other connection arrangements are also possible for use when testing individual systems, ECUs, or bench testing components.\n\nA USB 2.0 port is provided to connect to laptops or other computers. Power can also be provided directly via the OBD II connection, by direct 12V DC connection, or via an AC mains adapter power supply. Auto-X also contains several communication modules, such as WIFI, Bluetooth, and 3G, for both short-range and long-range communications making it easy to communicate with remote cloud or smart mobile phones.\n\nAuto-X performs an automated sequence of test scenarios using either the local or cloud-based testing portal. Each scenario test time can range from minutes to hours, which varies depending on the vehicle configuration and equipment. The tool injects CAN traffic into the vehicle CAN bus. By monitoring and recording CAN traffic and responses, the testing portal then analyzes the logs and responses aiming to detect unexpected, unwanted, or potentially harmful security issues.\n\nAuto-X acts as an interface between the entity being tested (an entire vehicle, a single CAN bus, multiple CAN buses, or a component, such as a specific Electronic Control Unit or ECU) and the secure cloud test portal (where the testing scripts reside). It also connects to the user's laptop to control and monitor activity during testing. Once connected to the vehicle, Auto-X can run a series of test scripts or protocols from the cloud portal.",
