  "Description": "JTAGulatoris an open source hardware hacking tool that assists in identifying on-chip debug interfaces from test points, vias, or component pads on a circuit board. The tool can save a tremendous amount of time during reverse engineering, particularly for those who don't have the skill and/or equipment required for traditional processes. Released at Black Hat USA 2013, the tool supports detection of JTAG and asynchronous serial/UART interfaces. New features are being added as they're developed to expand the functionality and increase support for other protocols.",
