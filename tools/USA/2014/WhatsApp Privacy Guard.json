  "Description": "With the PRISM scandal, we began to question whether Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook were the only companies working with governments to spy on the behavior of its citizens. Will WhatsApp be one of these companies? Does WhatsApp store its user conversations? These sort of things make us think that users are defenseless and have no current measures to ensure the privacy of content shared on these platforms.",
