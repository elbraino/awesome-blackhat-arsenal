  "Description": "A world without malware is ideal but unlikely. Many of us would prefer *not* to install another layer of protection on our already-resource-constrained handheld mobile device. Alternatively, Android malware detection sans anti-virus installation has become a reality. Learn about how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to detect mobile malware using simple text messages with ZitMo NoM. ZeuS in the Mobile, known as ZitMo, is infamous for intercepting SMS transmissions then redirecting them to a Command and Control in order steal banking and personal information. Research with SMS transmissions directed at mobile malware has resulted in the ability to detect ZitMo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence without anti-virus applications installed. Turning cyber criminals' tools against them makes this even more of a rewarding endeavor. We are looking for malware researchers to contribute to the continued development of this open tool. The presentation will include the research, the infrastructure, and a demonstration of ZitMo NoM. Live malware will be used during this presentation, assuming we get it to behave.",
