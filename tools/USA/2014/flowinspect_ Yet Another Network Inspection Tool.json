  "Description": "Flowinspect is a tool developed specifically for network monitoring and inspection purposes. It takes network traffic as input and extracts layer 4 flows from it. These flows are then passed through an inspection engine that filters and extracts interesting network sessions. For flows that meet inspection criteria, the output mode dumps match statistics to either stdout or a file or both.",
