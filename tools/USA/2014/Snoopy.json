  "Description": "Snoopy is a distributed tracking, data interception, and profiling framework. The software can run on small, cost-effective hardware (BeagleBone, RaspberryPi) and be deployed over a large area (we call these 'drones'). Each Snoopy drone passively or actively collects information on people who walk past from the array of wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) devices that they carry on their person. This information is synchronized to a central server where we can visually explore it with tools like Maltego.",
