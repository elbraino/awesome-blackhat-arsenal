  "Description": "Morning Catch is a Virtual Machine environment, similar to Metasploitable, to demonstrate and teach about targeted client-side attacks. Morning Catch is a fictitious seafood company with a website, self-contained email infrastructure to receive phishing emails, and two desktop environments. One desktop environment is a vulnerable Linux client-side attack surface. The other desktop environment is a vulnerable Windows client-side attack surface. Yes, you'll get to attack a Windows software target and use Windows payloads against this virtual environment. This Arsenal session will demonstrate some of the things you can do with the Morning Catch environment.",
