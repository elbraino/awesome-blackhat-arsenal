  "Description": "Detecting malware is difficult, and analyzing a detected piece of malware's behavior is even more difficult. Techniques for analysis generally fall into one of three camps: static analysis of the malicious binary on disk, dynamic analysis as the binary executes, or a hybrid approach using a snapshot of physical RAM taken as the malware executes. As the result of our DARPA Cyber Fast Track (CFT) funded research, we extend this third approach. We present a novel technique for leveraging information including multiple snapshots of physical RAM for malware detection and analysis. The technique is implemented as DAMM, a tool for differential analysis of malware in memory. DAMM functions by leveraging multiple snapshots of RAM, domain knowledge about known-benign in-memory artifacts, and indicators of malicious activity to present to the user a powerful view of malicious execution in memory.",
