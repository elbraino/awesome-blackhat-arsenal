  "Description": "ProxyMe is a modular HTTP/S proxy based on plugins. It's designed and oriented for pen-testing or research purposes. It also has support for analyzing and modifying the traffic, SSL included. It can be used as a regular proxy or as a reverse proxy, supporting also transparent connections, making it perfect for combined attacks of Man In The Middle (or even as a load balancer if you want!).",
