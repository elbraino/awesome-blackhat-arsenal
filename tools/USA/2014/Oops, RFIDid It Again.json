  "Description": "Last year, we delivered the definitive guide for pen-testers on hacking low frequency (LF - 125KHz) RFID badge systems to gain unauthorized access to buildings and other secure areas.  In this second installment, weâre raising the stakes, peeling back the onion even further, and directly confronting the RFID elephant in the room â hacking High Frequency (HF - 13.56 MHz) and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF â 840-960 MHz).",
