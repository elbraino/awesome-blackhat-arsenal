## 📱 Mobile Security
<details><summary><strong>Android Device Testing Framework</strong></summary>

![Category: 📱 Mobile Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20📱%20Mobile%20Security-yellow) ![None](https://img.shields.io/badge/None-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Android Device Testing Framework](https://github.com/Thangarajtk/appium-mobileAutomationFramework)  
📝 **Description:** The Android Device Testing Framework ("dtf") is a data collection and analysis framework to help individuals answer the question: "Where are the vulnerabilities on this mobile device?"  Dtf provides a modular approach and built-in APIs that allows testers to quickly create scripts to interact with their Android devices.  The default download of dtf comes with multiple modules that allow testers to obtain information from their Android device, process this information into databases, and then start searching for vulnerabilities (all without requiring root privileges).  These modules help you focus on changes made to AOSP components such as applications, frameworks, system services, as well as lower-level components such as binaries, libraries, and device drivers.  In addition, youâll be able to analyze new functionality implemented by the OEMs and other parties to find vulnerabilities.

![Category: 📱 Mobile Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20📱%20Mobile%20Security-yellow) ![None](https://img.shields.io/badge/None-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Smartphone Pen-Test Framework](https://github.com/tanprathan/MobileApp-Pentest-Cheatsheet)  
📝 **Description:** As smartphones enter the workplace, sharing the network and accessing sensitive data, it is crucial to be able to assess the security posture of these devices in much the same way we perform penetration tests on workstations and servers. However, smartphones have unique attack vectors that are not currently covered by available industry tools. The smartphone penetration testing framework, the result of a DARPA Cyber Fast Track project, aims to provide an open source toolkit that addresses the many facets of assessing the security posture of these devices. We will look at the functionality of the framework including information gathering, exploitation, social engineering, and post exploitation through both a traditional IP network and through the mobile modem, showing how this framework can be leveraged by security teams and penetration testers to gain an understanding of the security posture of the smartphones in an organization. SPF can be used as a pivot to gain access to an internal network, gaining access to additional vulnerabilities. SPF can be used to bypass filtering, using SMS to control an exploited internal system. Demonstrations of SPF functionality will be shown.

<details><summary><strong>ZitMo NoM</strong></summary>

![Category: 📱 Mobile Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20📱%20Mobile%20Security-yellow) ![None](https://img.shields.io/badge/None-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [ZitMo NoM](https://github.com/CyberMonitor/defcon-26-Packet-Hacking-Village/blob/master/presentations-workshops.html)  
📝 **Description:** A world without malware is ideal but unlikely. Many of us would prefer *not* to install another layer of protection on our already-resource-constrained handheld mobile device. Alternatively, Android malware detection sans anti-virus installation has become a reality. Learn about how itâs possible to detect mobile malware using simple text messages with ZitMo NoM. ZeuS in the Mobile, known as ZitMo, is infamous for intercepting SMS transmissions then redirecting them to a Command and Control in order steal banking and personal information. Research with SMS transmissions directed at mobile malware has resulted in the ability to detect ZitMoâs presence without anti-virus applications installed. Turning cyber criminals' tools against them makes this even more of a rewarding endeavor. We are looking for malware researchers to contribute to the continued development of this open tool. The presentation will include the research, the infrastructure, and a demonstration of ZitMo NoM. Live malware will be used during this presentation, assuming we get it to behave.

Nowadays, 15 years later, common programming mistakes are still being implemented in many ELF parsers that are being released these days very often, either as debuggers, reverse engineering tools, AV analyzers, plugins or as malware (yes, malware has parsers too). Here's where ELF file format fuzzing comes into the game to help you to identify these bugs in an automated fashion.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** The stream of malicious software artifacts (malware) discovered daily by computer security professionals is a vital signal for threat intelligence, as malware bears telling clues about who active adversaries are, what their goals are, and how we can stop them.  Unfortunately, while security operations centers collect huge volumes of malware daily, this âmalware signalâ goes underutilized as a source of defensive intelligence, because organizations lack the right tools to make sense of malware at scale.

<details><summary><strong>DAMM: A Tool for Differential Analysis of Malware in Memory</strong></summary>

![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![None](https://img.shields.io/badge/None-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [DAMM: A Tool for Differential Analysis of Malware in Memory](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/DAMM)  
📝 **Description:** Detecting malware is difficult, and analyzing a detected piece of malware's behavior is even more difficult. Techniques for analysis generally fall into one of three camps: static analysis of the malicious binary on disk, dynamic analysis as the binary executes, or a hybrid approach using a snapshot of physical RAM taken as the malware executes. As the result of our DARPA Cyber Fast Track (CFT) funded research, we extend this third approach. We present a novel technique for leveraging information including multiple snapshots of physical RAM for malware detection and analysis. The technique is implemented as DAMM, a tool for differential analysis of malware in memory. DAMM functions by leveraging multiple snapshots of RAM, domain knowledge about known-benign in-memory artifacts, and indicators of malicious activity to present to the user a powerful view of malicious execution in memory.

🔗 **Link:** [WhatsApp Privacy Guard](https://github.com/StellarSand/privacy-settings/blob/main/Privacy%20Settings/WhatsApp.md)  
📝 **Description:** With the PRISM scandal, we began to question whether Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook were the only companies working with governments to spy on the behavior of its citizens. Will WhatsApp be one of these companies? Does WhatsApp store its user conversations? These sort of things make us think that users are defenseless and have no current measures to ensure the privacy of content shared on these platforms.
