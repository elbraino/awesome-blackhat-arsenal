  "Description": "ANWI is a new type of Wireless Intrusion Detection System which is based on a low cost WiFi module (ESP8266) and can be deployed at physical perimeter of the coverage area. It allows organizations which can't afford expensive WIDS solutions to protect their networks at fraction of the cost involved.\n\nANWI provides three layers of protection:\n\nDetect the most commonly used WiFi attacks including Evil Twin, Jamming using de-authentication frames, attacks conducted using commonly used WiFi attack frameworks\nBlock unauthorized WiFi Access Points created in organization premises\nSecure organizations AP by performing WiFi Geo-Fencing to prevent access outside of designated perimeter\n\nANWI supports standalone as well as managed mode for sending alerts. It also has ability to use separate radio for sending alerts as added resiliency.ANWI aims to fulfill the need of WIDS which is inexpensive yet can protect against most of the possible attacks. It is easy to setup and deploy and works on \"fire and forget principle\". Once the sensors have been configured they can be deployed across the perimeter. The sensors send heartbeat signal and in case any of the sensors goes offline an alert is generated by server. The current production version includes all the above features.",
