  "Description": "When it comes to the security of the information system, Active Directory domain controllers are, or should be, at the center of concerns, which are (normally) to ensure compliance with best practices, and during a compromise proved to explore the possibility of cleaning the information system without having to rebuild Active Directory. However, few tools implement this process; there are more and more offensive tools to target Active Directory and several ways exist to backdoor Active Directory.\n\nWe propose to present some possible backdoors which could be set by an intruder in Active Directory to keep administration rights. For example, how to modify the AdminSDHolder container in order to reapply rights after administrator actions. Moreover, backdoors can be implemented in Active Directory to help an intruder to gain back his privileges. Then, we will present the last features in BTA, which help to detected all mis-configurations that can be abused to bypass Administrative Forest Design Approach \"ESAE\", as DCsync rights, Exchange privileges...\n\nThe presentation will be organized as follows:\n\nWe begin by demonstrating some backdoors in order to keep admins rights or to help an intruder to quickly recover admins rights.\nWe will continue by describing all mis-configurations that can be abused to bypass ESAE design, as DCsync rights, Exchange privileges...\nWe conclude with a feedback on real world usage of BTA.\n\nMore information can be found on the Bitbucket repository: https://github.com/airbus-seclab/bta",
