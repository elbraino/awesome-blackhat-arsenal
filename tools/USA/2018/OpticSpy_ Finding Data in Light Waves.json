  "Description": "OpticSpy is an open source hardware module for experimenting with optical data transmissions. It captures, amplifies, and converts an optical signal from a visible or infrared light source into a digital form that can be analyzed or decoded with a computer.\n\nWith OpticSpy, hardware hackers can search for optical covert channels, which intentionally exfiltrate data in a way undetectable to the human eye, explore signals from remote controls and other consumer electronic devices that send information through light, or discover Li-Fi networks and Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems.",
