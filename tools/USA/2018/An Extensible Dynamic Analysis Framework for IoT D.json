  "Description": "As IoT devices are more than ever present in our society, their security is becoming an increasingly important issue. Dynamic analysis has been proved the arsenal to many security applications (e.g., malware analysis, vulnerability discovery, backdoor analysis, etc.). While several dynamic analysis systems(Avatar, FEMU, Firmadyne, etc. ) have been proposed for IoT devices, they either rely on IoT hardware(Avatar), or lack user friendly interfaces for further extension. In this talk, we will present an extensible whole-system dynamic analysis framework for IoT devices. Specifically, on top of QEMU, we build a Pintool-like framework FirmPin, which provides Just-In-Time Virtual Machine Introspection and a plugin architecture with a simple-to-use event-driven programming interface. FirmPin provides the instrumentation at basic block level, system call level and memory access level for both user level and kernel level programs. Currently, FirmPin supports ARM and MIPS and can run customized kernel from Firmadyne project.\n\nTo demonstrate the power of FirmPin, we have created two plugins - MalScalpel and FirmFuzzer. MalScalpel is able to collect the instruction trace, system call trace, and unpacked code of the monitored program(e.g., Mirai). FirmFuzzer utilizes FirmPin to collect the execution information of fuzzed IoT applications, and integrates with AFL to conduct efficient fuzzing for IoT applications. In the future, we plan to add tainting, a powerful technique for many security applications, to the system. The ultimate goal of FirmPin is to be a general analysis framework for IoT devices.\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/DeepBitsTechnology/FirmPin\ufeff",
