  "Description": "Started as pet project in 2011, wpa-sec collects WPA handshake captures from all over the world. Contributors use client script to download handshakes and special crafted dictionaries to initiate attack against PSKs. With more than 115 GB captures from 240,000 submissions, collected samples represent invaluable source for wireless security research. This includes:\n\nMany improvements for emerging wireless security tools like hcxtools suite (https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools)\nIdentified default PSK key generation algorithms, used by various ISPs. Those, along with fixes for current implementations get in RouterKeygen project (https://github.com/routerkeygen/routerkeygenPC). Many more to come, based on current research activities\nPerformance optimizations for WPA crackers\nIdentified some linux kernel driver bugs\n\nLive installation: https://wpa-sec.stanev.org\nGitHub: https://github.com/RealEnder/dwpa\ufeff\nPresentation: https://alex.stanev.org/presentations/en/BlackHatUSA2018_DEFCON26-PHV_wpa-sec_AlexStanev.pdf",
