  "Description": "In recent years, attacking air gapped networks through HID devices is becoming popular. The HID attack uses the USB interface to forge the user's keystrokes or mouse movement to modify the system settings and run malware. In 2009, NSA's Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO) developed the COTTON-MOUTH \u2013 a USB hardware implant which provides a wireless bridge into a target network as well as the ability to load exploit software onto a target machine. Unlike COTTON-MOUTH, Ghost Tunnel attacks the target through the HID device only to release the payload, and it can be removed after the payload is released.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nCovertness\nHID attack device is only required to release the payload and it can be removed after that\nNo interference with the target's existing connection status and communications\nCan bypass firewalls\nCan be used to attack strictly isolated networks\nCommunication channel does not depend on the target's existing network connection\nCross-Platform Support\nCan be used to attack any device with wireless communication module, we tested this attack on Window 7 up to Windows 10, and OSX\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/360PegasusTeam/GhostTunnel",
