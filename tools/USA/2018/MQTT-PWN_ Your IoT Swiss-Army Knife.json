  "Description": "MQTT is a machine-to-machine connectivity protocol designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport and widely used by millions of IoT devices worldwide. MQTT-PWN intends to be a one-stop-shop for IoT Broker penetration-testing and security assessment operations, as it combines enumeration, supportive functions and exploitation modules while packing it all within command-line-interface with an easy-to-use and extensible shell-like environment.\nBuilt-in abilities/modules:\n\nCredential Brute-Forcer - configurable brute force password cracking to bypass authentication controls\nTopic enumerator - establishing comprehensive topic list via continuous and accumulated sampling\nBroker information grabber - obtaining and labeling data from an extensible predefined list containing known topics of interest, broker type and version and more\nGPS tracker - plotting routes from devices using OwnTracks app and collecting published coordinates, battery usage, connection method etc.\nSonoff exploiter \u2013 design to extract passwords and other sensitive information off smart switches\n\nA full circle of scenarios of attack using the tool will be demonstrated.",
