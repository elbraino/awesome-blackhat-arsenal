  "Description": "Expl-iot is an open source flexible and extendable framework for IoT Security Testing and exploitation. It will provide the building blocks for writing exploits and other IoT security assessment test cases with ease. Expliot will support most IoT communication protocols, firmware analysis, hardware interfacing functionality and test cases that can be used from within the framework to quickly map and exploit an IoT product or IoT Infrastructure. It will help the security community in writing quick IoT test cases and exploits. The objectives of the framework are:\n\nEasy of use\nExtendable\nSupport for hardware, radio and IoT protocol analysis\n\nWe are currently working on the python3 version and will release it in a month. The new Alpha release is envisioned to have support for UART(serial), ZigBee, BLE, MQTT, CoAP (next version will have support for JTAG, I2C and SPI) and few miscellaneous test cases.\n\nSource Code: https://gitlab.com/expliot_framework/expliot",
