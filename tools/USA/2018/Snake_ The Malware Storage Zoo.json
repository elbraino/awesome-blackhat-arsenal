  "Description": "Snake is a malware storage zoo that was built out of the need for a centralized and unified storage solution for malicious samples that could seamlessly integrate into the investigation pipeline. Snake utilizes a plugin system to provide extensive static analysis capability along with interface capability to allow interaction with 3rd party platforms, such as Cuckoo. Snake adheres to the RESTful API philosophy and as a result allows for seamless interaction with 3rd party tools from within a single UI. It provides enough information to allow analysts to quickly and efficiently pivot to the most suitable tools for the task at hand.",
