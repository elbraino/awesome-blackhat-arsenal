  "Description": "Mobile applications are critical when it comes to vulnerabilities in production environment. The only option to remove a product issue is to force update the app, which isn't a good user experience, especially when the app download size is high. With this project, we aim to automate the manual security testing and leverage developers with a tool which helps them identify bugs well in advance. The goal of MAFIA is to perform end to end security testing for a given mobile app and create a self serve tool for developers and security engineers.",
