  "Description": "The analysis of malware behavior in network activity and event logs is a costly and time-consuming task. Even with automated techniques, inspection of network traffic in tools such as Wireshark is often tedious and overwhelming due to the many packet details.\n\nWe need faster techniques to speedup the discovery of malware activity and gain insight in our event logs by combining machine learning and visualization together. To this end we developed \"Eventpad - the notepad editor for event data\", a tool that enables analysts to quickly analyze network traffic by exploiting the human mind. Eventpad is a visual analytics tool that enables analysts to visually inspect system events as blocks on a screen. Just like a notepad editor find&replace, conditional formatting, and rewrite functionality can be used to accurately search and highlight system vulnerabilities in these block collections. Together with automated techniques such as clustering and multiple sequence alignment analysts can quickly drill down and extract nontrivial patterns and threat indicators from network conversations and event logs.\n\nWe demonstrate how we can use Eventpad to quickly discover patterns in PCAP DPI traffic. In particular, we give live demos on how we can use the tool to discover protocol misusage in VoIP traffic and reverse engineer Ransomware viruses in back office environments.",
