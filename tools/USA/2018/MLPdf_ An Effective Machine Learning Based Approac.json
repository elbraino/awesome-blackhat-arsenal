  "Description": "Due to the popularity of portable document format (PDF) and increasing number of vulnerabilities in major PDF viewer applications, malware writers continue to use it to deliver malware via web downloads, email attachments and other methods in both targeted and non-targeted attacks. The topic on how to effectively block malicious PDF documents has received huge research interests in both cyber security industry and academia with no sign of slowing down.\n\nIn this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model, termed MLPdf, for the detection of PDF based malware. More specifically, the MLPdf model uses a backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient decent search for model update. A group of high quality features are extracted from two real-world datasets which comprise around 105000 benign and malicious PDF documents. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed MLPdf approach exhibits excellent performance which significantly outperforms all evaluated eight well known commercial anti-virus scanners with a much higher true positive rate (TPR) of 95.12% achieved while maintaining a very low false positive rate of 0.08%. Of the evaluated commercial AV scanners, the best scanner only has a TPR of 84.53%, which is over 10% lower than the proposed MLPdf model. In the demonstration, we will first manually analyze a malicious PDF document , then show how it can be automatically detected by the proposed ML approach.\n\nPresentation: https://github.com/cyberML/MLPdf/blob/master/BlackHatUSA2018_MLPdf_slides.pdf\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06991",
