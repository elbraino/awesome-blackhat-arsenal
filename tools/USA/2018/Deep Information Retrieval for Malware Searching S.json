  "Description": "More than 300,000 new malware samples are generated everyday, and it is well known that traditional malware detection based on file hash and rules is very vulnerable to variants. It is also getting harder to categorize unknown malware samples because the cost of finding similar samples is increasing. Therefore, the necessity of malware information retrieval system has emerged. Several attempts have been researched to perform this task, but they have limitations in terms of polymorphism, complexity, ambiguity, novelty and so on.\n\nThis research seeks to remedy these problems by introducing a deep metric learning method and proposes a new malware retrieval system which has learned a semantic similarities of malware samples. This system could retrieve information from perceptually similar samples as well as structurally similar samples. It could deal with new samples rapidly and roles as a good feature extractor for another tasks like malware classification or categorization. This approach can be easily adapted to other neural network models because it doesn't change the structure of the original network.\n\nIn this presentation, we describe the problems that arise when creating a malware retrieval system, and how we solve them. Also we visualize the embedding vectors of malware samples and show the retrieval results to prove the synchronization between our perception on malware and embedding space.",
