QARK will perform static code analysis on Android applications, by decompiling them, parsing their manifests, and finally tokenizing the underlying Java code to allow full source-to-sink mapping.Unlike other tools QARK will also automatically create customized ADB commands to demonstrate vulnerabilities and probably coolest of all, it can create customized Proof-of-Concept apps to exploit the vulnerabilities it finds.",
