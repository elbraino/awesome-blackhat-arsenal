  "Description": "Bearded is an open source Security Automation platform. The platform allows Development, QA, and Security team members to perform automated web security scans with a set of tools (w3af, sslyze, nmap, arachni etc), and re-execute those scans as needed. All tools can be executed in the cloud in docker containers. Bearded has a default web interface which integrates all core options and makes it possible to manage large pentests easily.Similar to owtf or minion, but using docker containers and scalable for clouds.",
