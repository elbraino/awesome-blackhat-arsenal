  "Description": "UTIP is an open-source solution that automates phases of threat data extraction from unstructured sources, and maps extracted elements to the STIX standard. By utilizing UTIP, security analysts and practitioners can:- Focus on analysis, instead of spending time parsing text in a document- Apply customized contextualization and prioritization filters to the extraction process- Increase automated communication (M2M) by converting ingested data into structured format- Perform higher order analysis on data extracted from these documents, and determine trends otherwise unattainableThe solution utilizes Scrumblr and Sketchy (open-source provided by Netflix) to scrape advisories, the OpenNLP stack for natural language processing, and a few machine learning techniques. The underlying web platform runs on Django, with D3 (JS framework) utilized to visualize insights drawn.",
