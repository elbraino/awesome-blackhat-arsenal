Combine that with BDFProxy, a tool based on mitmProxy and BDF to MitM patch binaries during download over HTTP, pentesters can bring unique attack capabilities to red teaming engagements and other testing engagements. BDF/BDFProxy is included in multiple operating systems and frameworks including Kali-Linux, Veil-Evasion, BlackArch Linux, and MITMf.The presenter will demo multiple use cases, from red teaming, testing OS security, cover framework internals, writing custom scripts, and new features.",
