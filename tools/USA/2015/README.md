<details><summary><strong>CTF Tools</strong> — Yan Shoshitaishvili</summary>

**Track:** Arsenal Lab · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools)  
📝 **Description:** There are a lot of tools written for security research and CTFs, but fairly few gain enough traction to be packaged and distributed by the likes of Ubuntu, or even Kali. Worse, when they *are* packaged, the packaged versions are often hopelessly outdated. This is unfortunate, and causes most researchers to have to spend time tracking down, compiling, configuring, and installing these tools. Also, when a computer has to be reinstalled the process generally has to be done again. There is a need for a central repository of such tools to track them and allow security researchers to easily install them (without screwing up the whole host system!). This is the story of such a repository.I've gone through the list of tools I've used in CTFs and in my research I have found the ones that are not adequately packaged, and created a central place for install scripts. The build system works with simple shell scripts (for easier contribution of packages) and installs everything under ~/tools (or, really, any other directory), without any global system changes (except for apt-getting dependencies from official repositories). As far as I can tell, this is the first repository of obscure security research tools, and I think it'll be a useful thing for the community at large.

<details><summary><strong>Burp-hash</strong> — Scott Johnson, Tim MalcomVetter, Matt South</summary>

**Track:** Web AppSec · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/burp-hash/burp-hash](https://github.com/burp-hash/burp-hash)  
📝 **Description:** Burp-hash is a Burp Suite plugin. Many applications will hash parameters, such as ID numbers and email addresses for use in secure tokens, like session cookies. The plugin will passively scan requests looking for hashed values. Once a hashed value is found, it is compared to a table of parameters already observed in the application to find a match. The plugin keeps a lookout for parameters, such as usernames, email addresses, and ID numbers. It also keeps a lookout for hashes (SHA, MD5, etc). It hashes new data and compares to observed hashes. The user receives a notification if any hashes match. This automates the process of trying to guess common parameters used in the generation of hashes observed in an application.

<details><summary><strong>CuckooSploit</strong> — David Oren</summary>

**Track:** Web AppSec · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/davidoren/CuckooSploit](https://github.com/davidoren/CuckooSploit)  
📝 **Description:** CuckooSploit is an environment for comprehensive, automated analysis of web-based exploits, based on Cuckoo sandbox. The framework accepts URL or a PCAP file, and works at three levels:Exploitation Process - Detecting the core components of the exploitation process (ROP chains, shellcodes, and heap sprays) for when exploitation takes place but fails to launch payload for several reasons, along with immediate successful post-exploitation phenomena (example, process creation). Full Flow Emulation - Implementing the approach of full web emulation, rather than emulation of a single file at a time, since many exploits served by Exploit Kits do not work out of the web-page context (require configurations and/or arguments). Web Flow Detection Redirection sequence chains, JavaScript obfuscations, evasion techniques. By using full web emulation on different combinations of OS/browser/plugin version, CuckooSploit increases the rate of malicious URL detection and presents a reliable verdict and, in some cases, CVE identification.

<details><summary><strong>SecLists</strong> — Jason Haddix, Daniel Miessler</summary>

**Track:** Web AppSec · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)  
📝 **Description:** If you have been in the industry a little while you start to realize that tools are only as good as their fuzz lists. Great lists are the secret sauce behind mapping, bruteforcing, web exploitation, etc. The SecLists project is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, mapping/discovery, and many more. Our goals are to enable a security tester to pull this repo onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed. This makes security testers less reliant on one tool and more empowered to write their own (or use the one of their choice). Come check out this project and we will walk you through several usages for the seclists project using your favorite proxies (Burp + ZAP, ++) and show how you can use it to enhance your current testing methodology!

<details><summary><strong>Active Directory Backdoors: Myth or Reality BTA: Open-Source Tool for AD Analysis</strong> — Joffrey Czarny</summary>

**Track:** Exploitation and Ethical Hacking · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/airbus-seclab/bta](https://github.com/airbus-seclab/bta)  
📝 **Description:** When it comes to the security of the information system, Active Directory domain controllers are, or should be, at the center of concerns, which are (normally) to ensure compliance with best practices, and during a compromise proved to explore the possibility of cleaning the information system without having to rebuild Active Directory. However, few tools implement this process and several ways exist to backdoor Active Directory. We propose to present some possible backdoors which could be set by an intruder in Active Directory to keep administration rights. For example, how to modify the AdminSDHolder container in order to reapply rights after administrator actions. Moreover, backdoors can be implemented in Active Directory to help an intruder to gain back his privileges. Then, we will present BTA, an audit tool for Active Directory databases, and our methodology for verifying the application of good practices and the absence of malicious changes in these databases. The presentation will be organized as follows:- We begin by describing the stakes around the Active Directory, centerpiece of any information system based on Microsoft technologies.- We will continue by demonstrating some backdoors in order to keep admins rights or to help an intruder to quickly recover admins rights.- We will present BTA and the methodology developed to analysis Active Directory. We conclude with a feedback on real world usage of BTA.More information can be found on the Bitbucket repository https: //bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta

**Track:** Malware Offense · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/gaffe23/linux-inject](https://github.com/gaffe23/linux-inject)  
📝 **Description:** Have you ever wanted to inject code into a Linux process, but found yourself lacking an easy way to do it? Ever wished Linux had a system call, like CreateRemoteThread on Windows? Linux-Inject is the tool you were wishing for! It can load a shared object inside another process, in much the same way Windows lets you load DLLs in other processes. It does this by attaching to the target process with ptrace and overwriting part of its address space with a custom loader. Once the target process has executed the loader, Linux-Inject restores the target's overwritten memory and register state and sends it on its merry way. At that point, it's up to you to wreak whatever havoc you'd like within the target process via the newly loaded shared object. Linux-Inject supports x86, x86_64, and ARM.

📝 **Description:** Today's digital ecosystem is harboring digital diseases that are increasingly resistant to antiviral measures. Many information security professionals continue to address the malware (digital disease pathogen) threat by focusing on antiviral methods and the re-imaging of infected hosts. The prevalence of infection is not conducive to the old reactive vaccination paradigm of one antidote signature for all. Can we learn from epidemiologists and how they investigate biological diseases? How do we enable more people to help in this digital medical crisis? We know there aren't enough people working on the digital disease problem, so how do we increase the numbers? This Digital Disease Control Web-Based Tracking app is an alpha proof of concept visualization tool, inspired by epidemiology, to enable entry level technicians to enter the security field.

**Track:** Malware Defense · **Event:** USA 2015  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben)  
📝 **Description:** Noriben is an open-source system monitoring tool that allows for quick and simplified tracking of malware activity. By wrapping its operation around Microsoft SysInternals Process Monitor, Noriben uses a comprehensive set of filters to generate very succinct reports that provide the required indicators to create Indicators of Compromise (IoC) alerts. Requirements:- Windows-based system with SysInternals Procmon.exe- Python 2.7.9 or 3.x.- Optional Python Requests and a VirusTotal public API key for VT lookups- Optional Python lib-yara for automated Yara scanningNoriben takes large volumes of system activity and filters out the background noise of system activity and legitimate operations. By focusing solely on important API calls, for file creation, registry operations, and network connections, Noriben creates a simple and straightforward report that features only the indicators that a security analyst or malware analyst cares about. Along with collecting indicators, Noriben will process all created or modified files through a collection of provided Yara signatures and detail any results. It will also submit any file hash to VirusTotal to collect its virus score. As Noriben runs in the background during live operation, it is also suitable to acquire activity while malware is being actively debugged by an analyst. This allows for the collection of artifacts not found during normal operation in standard sandboxes. Within 60 seconds an analyst can get a good handle on a malware's capability and determine if it's a new variant of a known family or something completely new and requiring reverse engineering. Noriben is currently in sophomore stages of development and is deployed in a number of malware analysis labs, including those run by federal law enforcement agencies and defense contractors, relying on its output simplicity to help analysts create actionable intelligence.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/openioc_scan](https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/openioc_scan)  
📝 **Description:** Indicator of Compromise (IOC) is a piece of information that can be used to search for or identify potentially compromised systems. Forensic investigators can define and share IOC files according to some standards or rules such as OpenIOC and YARA. Currently, many IOCs are available on the Internet, but most of the IOCs cannot be used for memory forensics because they are composed of indicators dependent on disk or live response data. Two years ago, I introduced "volatile IOCs" based on RAM evidence only at SANS DFIR Summit 2013. We can detect malware in memory images using them faster than using disk-based traditional IOCs. Besides, we can define indicators based on not only metadata like file paths but also malware functions such as code injection sign, imported functions, unpacked codes, and so on. However, in order to scan threats using volatile IOCs, we needed to use a closed-source tool based on OpenIOC standard. I could not improve it even if there were some limitations in the tool. That's why I implemented "openioc_scan" as a plugin for Volatility Framework which is an open-source memory forensic tool. In this demonstration, I explain how to use it and details of the implementation. Furthermore, I also show the results of considerations about IOCs to detect unknown malware in RAM by focusing on generic traits of malware.

📝 **Description:** We use Macs a lot at Yelp, which means that we see our fair share of Mac-specific security alerts. Host based detectors will tell us about known malware infestations or weird new startup items. Network based detectors see potential C2 callouts or DNS requests to resolve suspicious domains. Sometimes our awesome employees just let us know, "I think I have like Stuxnet or conficker or something on my laptop." When alerts fire, our incident response team's first goal is to "stop the bleeding" to contain and then eradicate the threat. Next, we move to "root cause the alert" figuring out exactly what happened and how we'll prevent it in the future. One of our primary tools for root causing OS X alerts is OSXCollector. OSXCollector is an open source forensic evidence collection and analysis toolkit for OS X. It was developed in-house at Yelp to automate the digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) our crack team of responders had been doing manually.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/7h3rAm/rudra](https://github.com/7h3rAm/rudra)  
📝 **Description:** Rudra provides a framework for automated inspection of network capture files. It extends upon another tool called flow inspect and adds subsequent file-format aware analytics to its feature set. It consumes network capture files as input and passes them through a file type-specific analysis chain. In this chain, the file is operated upon by individual modules like:- FileID - Populates metadata like file entropy, compression ratio, hashes, bitrate, average packet rate, duration, etc.- Libnids - Handles IP defragmentation and TCP reassembly- ProtoID - Custom-made, minimal, regex-based protocol identification module (currently supports HTTP/SMTP/FTP/IMAP/POP3 identification)- Heuristics Engine - Uses a stochastic model based flow scanning engine to detect network traffic abnormalities- Yara Scan - Uses Yara's file scanning features to identify malicious network streams- Shellcode Scan - Uses Libemu to emulate and identify x86 shellcode- Regex Scan - Helps to identify and extract useful pieces of information (hashes, email addresses, private API keys, password DBs, etc.) from network traffic flows- Entropy visualization wih graphing support- DNS/Whois/GeoIP (with Google Maps API v3 integration) modulesEach of these modules sends a report JSON that is then collated to provide a highly verbose summary of the capture file. The analyst has an option of requesting the report in any one of the supported formats (JSON, HTML, PDF).The framework provides command-line based interactive interface that exposes a file analysis object. This object can be used to scan files and generate reports. This architecture also allows quick embedding within third-party tools and applications. Most of the analysis modules accept configuration options and as such provide a faster alternative to directly tweaking codebase. With the above listed modules and features in place, the project is still under development. There are plan to extend its functionality beyond capture files to include binary and document formats with the first public release.
