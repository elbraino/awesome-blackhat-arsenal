🔗 **Link:** [Smartphone Pentest Framework](https://github.com/georgiaw)  
📝 **Description:** As smartphones enter the workplace, sharing the network and accessing sensitive data, it is crucial to be able to assess the security posture of these devices in much the same way we perform penetration tests on workstations and servers. However, smartphones have unique attack vectors that are not currently covered by available industry tools. The smartphone penetration testing framework, the result of a DARPA Cyber Fast Track project, aims to provide an open source toolkit that addresses the many facets of assessing the security posture of these devices. We will look at the functionality of the framework including information gathering, exploitation, social engineering, and post exploitation through both a traditional IP network and through the mobile modem, showing how this framework can be leveraged by security teams and penetration testers to gain an understanding of the security posture of the smartphones in an organization. SPF can be used as a pivot to gain access to an internal network, gaining access to additional vulnerabilities. SPF can be used to bypass filtering, using SMS to control an exploited internal system. Demonstrations of SPF functionality will be shown.

## 🧠 Reverse Engineering
<details><summary><strong>Binfuzz.js</strong></summary>

![Category: 🧠 Reverse Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🧠%20Reverse%20Engineering-orange) ![Artem Dinaburg](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artem%20Dinaburg-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Binfuzz.js](https://github.com/artemdinaburg/binfuzz)  
📝 **Description:** Binfuzz.js is a library for fuzzing structured binary data in JavaScript. Structured binary data is data that can be easily represented by one or more C structures: it is composed of fixed size fields and any variable length fields are counted by another structure member. Numerous network and file formats are structured binary data, including SSL, DNS, and most image formats. Things that aren't structured binary data include languages (such as HTML or JavaScript) or text-based protocols (such as HTTP) or text-based file formats (such as PDF). A live example will be shown using Binfuzz.js to generate Windows ICO files to stress a browser's icon parsing and display code. ICO is a complex format that contains images of different sizes for optimal display based on context. Binfuzz.js will try generating edge cases such as an icon with 0xFFFF images of size 0xFFFFFFFF by 0xFFFFFFF, and cases such as saying that there are 128 images but only supplying data for one, among many other permutations. It is the author's hope that others will extend binfuzz.js for other use cases.
