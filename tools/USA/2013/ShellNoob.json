  "Description": "Writing shellcode is usually really fun, but some parts are boring, error-prone, and insanely difficult to debug without the proper arsenal. ShellNoob is a tool that eases the writing and debugging of shellcode by taking care of all the parts that even a noob could do, and leaving only the fun part for the artist.",
