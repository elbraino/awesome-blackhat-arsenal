  "Description": "Dalvik is the process Virtual Machine used by Android that powers all non-native applications used on Android devices. Through Dalvik memory analysis, a wealth of insight can be gained into the workings of a running application, including all instantiated objects (classes) and the variables, methods, and other per-instance class information. Analysis of structures at this level will allow investigators to see internal application-level state in its ânativeâ form. This is an important evolution in state of cutting edge memory forensics, which allows the investigator to move above the kernel level and see higher-level structures in readable form and with broad context.",
