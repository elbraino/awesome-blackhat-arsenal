  "Description": "The purpose of sphere of influence was to address the shortcomings of visualizations with regards to a tactical awareness. The IP address-to-geographical location and organization was designed to aid in the removal of false positives.  It also provides details about location, latitude/longitude and organizational information.  It addressed the fact that the majority of attacks were coming from the United States and China or from countries with high levels of broadband access.",
