  "Description": "Artemis is a modular vulnerability scanner powering CERT PL (Polish national CERT) large-scale scanning activities. It checks various aspects of website security and builds easy-to-read reports informing organizations about the scanning results.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, we scanned almost 500 thousand domains and subdomains in our constituency and found more than 200 thousand vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Identified issues ranged from minor - lack of proper SSL or DMARC configuration, to critical, such as SQL Injection and RCEs.\n\nDuring the presentation, I'll describe the way Artemis works, what we are looking for, and most significantly - lessons we've learned during our large-scale scanning project. Since the tool is open-source, I'll touch upon how to set up your own scanning pipeline and implement new modules.",
