  "Description": "The Splunk Attack range is a open-source framework that provides different tools to allow security analysts to test networks, hosts, and applications against several known adversarial TTPs based on Mitre ATT&CK framework. The Splunk Attack Range framework allows the security analyst to quickly and repeatedly replicate and generate data as close to \"ground truth\" as possible, in a format that allows the creation of detections, investigations, knowledge objects, and SOAR playbooks. The Splunk Attack Ranges contain adversarial simulation engines (Operator, Atomic Red Team), target machines, and a Splunk server receiving attack data which can be downloaded and used for free and provides operators with tools to simulate attacks and create detections and defense artifacts.",
