  "Description": "Why does phishing still exist? Despite being one of the oldest types of cyberattacks, it continues to be effective. Cybersecurity remains a constant game of cat and mouse between the white and black hats with both sides continuously developing new strategies to outmaneuver each other. However, the past year marked a significant shift with the implementation of new generative AI models.\nHow does our brain identify a phishing website? By appearance! If a random domain closely resembles Facebook's login page or a login page of a bank website, it's probably phishing - That's the simple criterion.\n\nWe've developed a tool to detect phishing using these generative AI technologies and can \"visually\" analyze websites. Excitingly, the tool can run in real-time, catching most advanced phishing websites and enabling responses within milliseconds.\n\nIntroducing LooksPhishy, currently deployed in production. This tool offers complete customization, enabling the choice of target brands for detection, the option to focus on either logos or the full webpage, and the selection of the most suitable embedding model and LLM. It also gives a description of phishing type (E.g Fake finance website, Mimic login page of Microsoft, Fake shopping website..). It comes equipped with numerous examples for educational purposes and integrates seamlessly into any stack!",
