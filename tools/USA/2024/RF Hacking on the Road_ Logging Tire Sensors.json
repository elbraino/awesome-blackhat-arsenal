  "Description": "Build an SDR-based scanner to log transmissions from tire sensors!\n\nNearly every tire on every vehicle produced the last few decades contains a digital radio with a unique signature. By scanning, receiving, and logging these Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) sensor transmissions, you can essentially fingerprint individual tires. Such a TPM logger allows you to determine information about when and how often unique vehicles pass through a given location. You can also extract some information on the make of each vehicle and a rough estimate of its year of manufacture.\n\nIn this lab, you'll learn how and when TPM sensors transmit their data and how you can capture and log their communications. You'll then put together some Python code blocks to build a simple, SDR-based logger and test it on real TPM sensors.",
