  "Description": "mBAS is a set of Bluetooth tools for macOS platforms, including Bluetooth HCI request sniffer, fuzzer and Broadcom firmware SoC tools, etc. Among them, the HCI fuzzer helped me discover many Bluetooth kernel vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2020-3892, CVE-2020-3893, CVE-2020-3905, CVE-2020-3907, CVE-2020-3908 and CVE-2020-3912. With these tools, we can better understand the design and implementation of Bluetooth subsystem of macOS and other platforms.",
