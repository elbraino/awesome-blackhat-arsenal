  "Description": "Secrets like API tokens, encryption keys, and passwords are a keystone in the development world. They facilitate important functionality not only in the software that developers build, but also in the deployment, maintenance, integration, and security of both closed and open-source projects. Many companies providing services on the internet offer API tokens in multiple flavors that allow interaction with their systems, as does GitLab. Token-Hunter and Gitrob are complementary tools developed, augmented, and heavily used by GitLab's red team to support their engagements and, most importantly, find those exposed secrets and demonstrate their abuse!",
