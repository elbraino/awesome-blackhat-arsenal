  "Description": "Public GitHub is the most common place where developers share their code and tools that they develop (i.e., developed for an organization or themselves). Most developers and repository contributors do their best to remove sensitive information before they push their code into the GitHub. However, there are developers who often unknowingly/inadvertently neglect to remove sensitive information such as API tokens and user credentials (username & passwords) from their code prior to posting it. As a result, an organization's internal secrets and token are exposed publicly. Therefore, an unauthorized access to the secrets GitHub by bad actors can have significant consequences for organizations. In order to address the issue, we offer xGitGuard, a full-fledge AI-based tool that detects organizations' secrets and user credentials posted on the public GitHub in a scalable and timely-manner fashion. xGitGuard, takes advantage of a new text processing algorithm that can find secrets within files with a high level of accuracy. This can significantly help operations to take proper actions in timely manner.",
