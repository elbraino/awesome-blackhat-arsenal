  "Description": "capa is an open-source tool that detects capabilities in programs to reduce the time-to-triage and make malware analysis more accessible. Anyone dealing with potentially malicious programs and especially forensic, intelligence, and malware analysts can use capa to understand a sample's capabilities, role (downloader, backdoor, etc.), and any suspicious or unique functionality.\ncapa takes automated malware triage to the next level going from simply saying \"this is probably bad\" to providing a concise description of what a program actually does. This report provides critical, decision-making information to anyone dealing with malware.\n\ncapa uses a new algorithm that reasons over the features found in a file to identify its capabilities. The lowest level features range from disassembly tricks to coding constructs, while intermediate features include references to recognized strings or API calls. Users compose rules that train capa how to reason about features \u2013 and even the significance of other rules. This makes it easy for the community to extend the tool's abilities.\n\nWe will describe how and why our tool works. We will also show to use it to enhance every malware analysis workflow. Furthermore, you will learn how to develop capability detections that extend capa.",
