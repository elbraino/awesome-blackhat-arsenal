  "Description": "Introducing DeepSea, the phishing gear you will want to take with you on your next offensive expedition. \n\nIt is designed to help Red Team operators and teams with the tactical delivery of opsec-tight, flexible email phishing campaigns carried out in a portable manner on the outside as well as on the inside \nof a perimeter. \n\nHave you ever wanted to seamlessly operate with external and internal email providers; quickly re-target connectivity parameters per campaign; flexibly add headers, targets, attachments, correctly format and inline email templates, images and multipart messages; use content templates for personalization; clearly separate artifacts and content delivery for multiple (parallel or sequential) phishing campaigns; get actionable context help and deploy with minimal dependencies? \n\nIn this session, we will show how you can do this and more in a portable, one binary cross platform setup, with less than 50 lines in a configuration file. \n\nWith DeepSea, you will be able to keep campaign persistence with DNS tricks and an embedded email server used for running advanced two-way threaded campaigns you have always wanted. Catch and respond to those often missed inquiry emails, solidifying pretext and pacifying your marks.\n\nWhether you plan on executing phishing campaigns deep on the inside of the perimeter, or bounce across multiple email providers for an external stealthy campaign delivery, DeepSea is very likely able to help.",
