  "Description": "Mole is a new open source framework for identifying and exploiting out-of-band (OOB) application vulnerabilities in applications. Mole provides an all-in-one payload generation framework and callback/payload server that streamlines the OOB payload creation and exploitation process\n\nMole takes inspiration from tools such as BurpSuite's Collaborator, XSS Hunter, but improves upon them in several key ways. Mole decouples the monitoring and payload generation from the testing tooling allowing for the 24x7 monitoring of OOB interaction. With this release, Mole supports the tracking of both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS interaction for all supported payload types which include XSS, XXE, PDF, and OOXML. These payloads can be generated and saved to a directory for manual testing, dynamically inserted into requests with Mole's Burp Suite Extension, or retrieved via API for custom integrations.\n\nMole tracks OOB interaction with customizable tracking tokens, which are stored on the callback server. When a valid token is presented to the callback server, either a pre-defined notification is sent, a custom web hook is invoked, or a payload server is invoked. The tracking token length and character set can be customized to work around exploitation constraints. During payload creation, context can be added to each tracking token through the tags feature. These tags are returned in any notifications and webhooks to easily identify which payload fired and in what context.\n\nMole's plugin framework allows it to be easily extended by creating custom payloads and payload servers. Plugins can specify both payload creation and server-side payload actions such as dynamically serving DTDs for an XXE payload.",
