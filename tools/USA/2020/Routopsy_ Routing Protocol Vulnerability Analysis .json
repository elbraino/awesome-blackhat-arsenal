  "Description": "Routopsy is a new network attack toolkit that leverages a \"virtual router\" in a Docker container to scan for and attack various networking protocols and misconfigurations. Vulnerabilities include overly broad configured network statements within routing protocols, unauthenticated or plaintext authentication for protocols such as OSPF and HSRP, and the lack of passive interface usage within routing protocols.\n\nRoutopsy was designed in a way that will allow users to trivially perform attacks without requiring extensive networking knowledge. Attacks include the injection of new routes, discovery of new networks and gateway takeover attacks which ultimately could lead to Person-in-the-Middle attacks. Additionally, a fully-fledged router interface is also available for more experienced users and for more advanced attacks.\n\nInternally, Routopsy leverages a \"virtual router\" which has been around for a number of years, is well maintained and supports a variety of protocols. Once the scan phase of Routopsy is complete a simple configuration is loaded within the virtual router and used to attack the target protocol.",
