  "Description": "Introduction to Industrial security: brief introduction to industrial cyber-attacks and why it's important to protect OT infrastructures. In this part I'll introduce the importance of industrial security, speak about Stuxnet and other dangerous attacks that had impact in industrial sector, and some prevention tips.\n\nIntroduction to Kouba: proposing a simple methodology that includes enumeration, footprinting and automatic exploitation with open tools. Presenting the advantages of using Debian with these specific tools* instead of Kali, and how to apply public key/password encryption and magic-wormhole using the scripts for securely exporting encrypted logs out of the virtual machine.\n\nChoosing open hardware for attacks: Once we have footprinted the devices and machines in the OT, in case we have physical access to the infrastructure, there are some things to look for regarding to physical security, such as USB ports, RTU (remote terminal units) details or DNP3 protocol serial communication. Using Arduino nano, pro mini, leonardo and attiny85 for designing either badusb or specific tools; RPI4/3/ZERO; ATMega2560 customizable PLC (PLDuino); S232 shield (for UNO), multi-protocols shield; Radio modules and others.\n\n* The system includes Redpoint and other nmap scripts, Kamerka, Aztarma, PLCinject, S7Scan, ISF, etc as well as Python 2.7 and 3, git, xfce4 terminal, Docker and Vagrant for needed virtualization, Celery and Redis for Kamerka, openssl, clang and other few compiling tools.",
