  "Description": "If you are after red-team training, there are multiple excellent courses and online resources for practising adversary simulation. That's not the primary motivation behind Alfa labs.\n\nAlfa labs allows:\n- Blue/red teamers to test or demonstrate specific attacks/attack-paths (e.g. when GMSA edges were introduced into BloodHound).\n- Beginners to take a structured approach to learning Active Directory weaknesses (which have largely been practically accessible if you build your own lab, during workshops w/ limited spaces or commercial training).\n- Replicate any technical issues and confirm your results\n\nTherefore, stop by and spin up your own lab to practise your Windows Active Directory tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in isolation, or red-team your way through the dynamically-built Alfa labs.",
