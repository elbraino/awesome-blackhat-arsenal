  "Description": "Active Directory is the foundation of the infrastructure for many organizations. As of 2023, Metasploit has added a wide range of new capabilities and attack workflows to support Active Directory exploitation. This Arsenal demonstration will cover new ways to enumerate information from LDAP, attacking Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), leveraging Role Based Constrained Delegation, and using Kerberos authentication.\n\nThe Kerberos features added in Metasploit 6.3 will be a focal point. The audience will learn how to execute multiple attack techniques, including Pass-The-Ticket (PTT), forging Golden/Silver Tickets, and authenticating with AD CS certificates. Finally, users will see how these attack primitives can be combined within Metasploit to streamline attack workflows with integrated ticket management. The demonstration will also highlight inspection capabilities that are useful for decrypting traffic and tickets for debugging and research purposes.",
