  "Description": "Paladin Cloud is an extensible, Security-as-Code (SaC) platform designed to help developers and security teams reduce risks in their cloud environments. It functions as a policy management plane across multi-cloud and enterprise systems, protecting applications and data. The platform contains best practice security policies and performs continuous monitoring of cloud assets, prioritizing security violations based on severity levels to help you focus on the events that matter..\n\nIts resource discovery capability creates an asset inventory, then evaluates security policies against each asset. Powerful visualization enables developers to quickly identify and remediate violations on a risk-adjusted basis. An auto-fix framework provides the ability to automatically respond to policy violations by taking predefined actions.\n\nPaladin Cloud is more than a tool to manage cloud misconfiguration. It's a holistic cloud security platform that can be used for continuous monitoring and reporting across any domain.",
