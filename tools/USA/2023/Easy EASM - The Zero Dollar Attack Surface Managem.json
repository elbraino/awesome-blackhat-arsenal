  "Description": "Easy EASM is just that... the easiest to set-up tool to give your organization visibility into its external facing assets.\n\nThe industry is dominated by $30k vendors selling \"Attack Surface Management,\" but OG bug bounty hunters and red teamers know the truth. External ASM was born out of the bug bounty scene. Most of these $30k vendors use this open-source tooling on the backend.\n\nWith ten lines of setup or less, using open source tools, and one button deployment, Easy EASM will give your organization a complete view of your online assets. Easy EASM scans you daily and alerts you via Slack or Discord on newly found assets! Easy EASM also spits out an Excel skeleton for a Risk Register or Asset Database! This isn't rocket science.. but it's USEFUL. Don't get scammed. Grab Easy EASM and feel confident you know what's facing attackers on the internet.",
