  "Description": "CAZT is a simulator of cloud-provider responsible REST APIs. It includes a lab manual for getting hands-on practice with how to attack authorization vulnerabilities in a cloud API.\n\nIt is different from other vulnerable cloud practice environments because it focuses on the cloud-provider shared responsibility instead of the customer. This enables pen testers to gain experience with testing the cloud vendor itself as well as an understanding of what a vulnerable cloud service will look like.",
