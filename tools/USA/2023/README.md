<details><summary><strong>BucketLoot - An Automated S3 Bucket Inspector</strong> — Umair Nehri, Owais Shaikh</summary>

**Track:** Cloud Security · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/redhuntlabs/BucketLoot](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/BucketLoot)  
📝 **Description:** Thousands of S3 buckets are left exposed over the internet, making it a prime target for malicious actors who may extract sensitive information from the files in these buckets that can be associated with an individual or an organisation. There is a limited research or tooling available that leverages such S3 buckets for looking up secret exposures and searching specific keywords or regular expression patterns within textual files. BucketLoot is an automated S3 Bucket Inspector that can simultaneously scan all the textual files present within an exposed S3 bucket from platforms such as AWS, DigitalOcean etc. It scans the exposed textual files for: - Secret Exposures - Assets (URLs, Domains, Subdomains) - Specific keywords | Regex Patterns (provided by the user) The end user can even search for string based keywords or provide custom regular expression patterns that can be matched with the contents of these exposed textual files. All of this makes BucketLoot a great recon tool for bug hunters as well as professional pentesters. The tool allows users to save the output in a JSON format which makes it easier to pass the results as an input to some third-party product or platform.

<details><summary><strong>DIAL - Did I Alert Lambda? Centralised Security Misconfiguration Detection Framework</strong> — Saransh Rana, Rashid Feroze, Harsh Varagiya</summary>

**Track:** Cloud Security · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/CRED-CLUB/DIAL](https://github.com/CRED-CLUB/DIAL)  
📝 **Description:** Workloads on the cloud provide equal opportunities for hackers as much as they do for internal teams. Cloud-native companies are open to attacks from both outside forces and from within. With the ever-growing risk of a security breach and cloud misconfiguration being one of the most common factors of the same, the mean time to detect is supposed to be reduced to seconds instead of minutes/hours. DIAL, or "Did I just alert Lambda?", is a cutting-edge security monitoring and alerting system that provides centralized visibility and analysis of potential internal threats and security misconfigurations across multiple AWS accounts. By leveraging the stateless nature of AWS Lambda, DIAL enables easy modular deployment and makes it highly scalable and cost-efficient, making it an efficient and effective tool for detecting and mitigating security risks. It's an event-driven framework, because of which detection time for identifying any security misconfiguration is less than 4 secs whereas traditional SIEM detection time for misconfigurations is more than 5-7 minutes and It can easily be deployed in any organization using its cloud formation stack. With DIAL, you can deploy a central security monitoring solution on your AWS accounts for pennies compared to deploying a traditional SIEM solution and can gain end-to-end visibility of their AWS infrastructure and receive timely alerts on issues like public database exposure and over-permissive IAM policies, helping them to proactively safeguard their systems and data.

## ⚙️ Miscellaneous / Lab Tools
<details><summary><strong>AI Risky Business: Hands-on AI Payload Analysis</strong> — Hyrum Anderson, Sagar Samtani, Christina Liaghati</summary>

**Track:** Arsenal Lab · Vulnerability Assessment · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** In their rush to adopt new AI technologies, many companies are turning to open source software, data and tools. But many do so without considering unmanaged risk in the AI Supply Chain. For example, current cybersecurity tooling does not account for ML-specific software vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary code execution in pytorch binary files), data vulnerabilities (e.g., corrupted datasets), or ML-specific behavioral vulnerabilities (e.g., universal triggers). This is where the AI Risk Database comes in. Like a "VirusTotal for AI", it provides an interface for community-driven reports about open source files, models and datasets. Only just released at the end of March 2023, the newly released tool has helped security researchers discover file vulnerabilities and model vulnerabilities in open source models generated by one provider. A major update at BlackHat arsenal will also include software scanning vulnerabilities provided by another 3rd-party provider. In this hands-on demonstration, we'll create vulnerable AI payloads and demonstrate their risk through the automated vulnerability scanning that powers AI Risk Database.

<details><summary><strong>Nekuda: IDN-Squatting Detector</strong> — Gal Bitensky, Adi Pick</summary>

**Track:** Web AppSec · Human Factors · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/G4LB1T/Nekuda](https://github.com/G4LB1T/Nekuda)  
📝 **Description:** Put yourself in the shoes of a fraudster, you are trying to create a phishing website. Why inserting detectable unicode characters into a mostly-ASCII domain when you can register an entire domain in unicode? This is available when one uses a lesser-known feature called Internationalized Domain Name Top Level Domains (IDN TLD). Consider registering domains like google.com's lookalike in Hebrew - גוגל.קום, アマゾン.コム in Japanese instead of amazon.com or 微软.公司 which is the Chinese equivalent of microsoft.com. Nekuda (dot in Hebrew) assists blue teamers to detect such domains. Its input is a string (e.g. the blue teamer's employer Brand name) and it emits over 150 potential IDN TLD domains and its registration status. It covers a potential gap in proactive phishing detection and prevention strategies and can be easily integrated into existing open-source tools like dnstwist.

<details><summary><strong>Swimming with the (Data)Flow – Analyzing & Visualizing Web Application Data Flows for Enhanced Penetration Testing</strong> — Florian Haag, Henry Wischerath, Matthias Göhring</summary>

**Track:** Web AppSec · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Imagine pentesting a large web application with hundreds of pages and forms, as well as user roles and tenants. You discover that your chosen username is reflected in many locations inside the application, but you don't have a detailed overview. You want to test whether the chosen username is handled properly or allows for injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting or Server-Site Template Injection. Now you face the challenge of finding all locations where your payloads appear when injecting into the username. In large applications, you'll likely miss some, potentially leaving vulnerabilities undetected. This is where FlowMate comes into play, our novel tool to detect data flows in applications for enhanced vulnerability assessments. FlowMate consists of two components: A BurpSuite plugin and a data flow graph based on Neo4j. It records inputs to the application as you go through the pages. In contrast to existing tools that require server-side access, FlowMate works from a black-box perspective by observing HTTP request and response pairs. Thereby FlowMate records all input parameters and locations as well as user-supplied values. In parallel, all HTTP responses from the server are matched against the central store of already identified parameter values to find occurrences of known input parameters. This results in a data graph, mapping inputs to outputs simply while using the application. Understanding the data flow results in a significant improvement of test coverage in web app pentests, as all input and output occurrences of parameters can be systematically tested for vulnerabilities. More precisely, analysts can use FlowMate in the following ways: First, for a given input parameter, FlowMate shows all output locations, thus enabling verification of output filtering and encoding, even across role, tenant, and session boundaries. Second, for a given form, FlowMate visualizes all parameters and their respective output locations across the application.

<details><summary><strong>Analyzing SAP Communication Security: Introducing sncscan</strong> — Nicolas Schickert, Jonas Wamsler, Matthias Göhring</summary>

**Track:** Code Assessment · Cryptography · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/usdAG/sncscan](https://github.com/usdAG/sncscan)  
📝 **Description:** SAP systems are used around the world to handle crucial business processes and highly confidential data such as financial details or information regarding a company's staff. To ensure confidentiality and integrity, sensitive data, and especially access credentials, must only be transmitted over encrypted communication channels. Transport layer encryption for SAP systems is provided by the Secure Network Communications (SNC) protocol. Currently, the configuration of the SAP SNC protocol (such as the Quality of Protection parameter or the installed CryptoLib) can only be audited with authenticated access to the SAP system or by manually connecting to the system through the SAP GUI. These approaches have additional requirements and are impractical for assessing the security of a larger number of systems. To address the beforementioned issues, we developed 'sncscan', an SNC scanner, that works without authentication and similar to the various tools that are available to analyze the security of services that use SSL/TLS. To achieve this, 'sncscan' starts SNC handshakes with varying encryption parameters to the tested service and analyzes the returned error messages and responses. This is especially useful in context of professional penetration tests and enables us to identify configuration weaknesses and provide actionable recommendations on improving the transport security in SAP environments. 'sncscan' benefits from the tools and research of the `pysap` project and will be released as Open-Source tool in the OWASP CBAS-SAP project. It aims to enable security researchers, professional penetration testers and SAP basis administrators to verify the correct use of the SNC protocol. Currently 'sncscan' can analyze the SNC configuration of the SAP Router protocol. The next steps are to implement similar functionality for the protocols DIAG and RFC to increase the coverage of SAP services.

<details><summary><strong>Daksh SCRA (Source Code Review Assist Tool)</strong> — Debasis Mohanty</summary>

**Track:** Code Assessment · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/coffeeandsecurity/DakshSCRA](https://github.com/coffeeandsecurity/DakshSCRA)  
📝 **Description:** Daksh SCRA is an open source tool that assists with manual source code review by providing helpful information to the code reviewer. This tool differs from traditional code review tools because it aims to help reviewers collect various details about the code base and identify areas of interest to review and confirm potential vulnerabilities. Even if code reviewers use automated code review tools, there are still many manual tasks they must perform to confirm findings and ensure precision in the code review process. Although there are numerous automated code review tools available, none of them can perform a reconnaissance of the code base and provide code reviewers with useful insights. Typically, code reviewers must search for relevant information to confirm findings or ensure precision. Daksh SCRA offers valuable information such as technology and platform usage, functionalities, use cases, vulnerable patterns, and libraries used, among other data. While most code review tools search for vulnerable patterns, they often report a high percentage of false positives. Daksh SCRA, on the other hand, is designed to be a reconnaissance tool that provides code reviewers with maximum insights about the target code base to assist with precise code review. Although Daksh SCRA is in its infancy stage, it is still a usable tool that supports a wide range of languages and platforms, and new features will be added in future releases.

**Track:** Android, iOS and Mobile Hacking · Reverse Engineering · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/rednaga/apkid](https://github.com/rednaga/apkid)  
📝 **Description:** APKiD is like "PEiD" for Android applications. It gives information on how an APK was built by fingerprinting compilers, packers, obfuscators, and protectors. The main idea behind the tool is to help provide context on how the APK was potentially built or changed after it was built. This is all context useful for attributing authorship and finding patterns. Extracting information about how the APK was made, it can provide a lot of information to assess the healthiness of an Android application (e.g. malware or pirated). The framework is the combination of a bunch of Yara rules and Python wrappers that scan files within APKs. Mainly, APKiD unpacks files and explores AndroidManifest.xml, DEX and ELF files to match rules and offers results based on them.

**Track:** Android, iOS and Mobile Hacking · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/joelambert/morf](https://github.com/joelambert/morf)  
📝 **Description:** MORF - Mobile Reconnaissance Framework is a powerful, lightweight, and platform-independent offensive mobile security tool designed to help hackers and developers identify and address sensitive information within mobile applications. It is like a Swiss army knife for mobile application security, as it uses heuristics-based techniques to search through the codebase, creating a comprehensive repository of sensitive information it finds. This makes it easy to identify and address any potentially sensitive data leak. One of the prominent features of MORF is its ability to automatically detect and extract sensitive information from various sources, including source code, resource files, and native libraries. It also collects a large amount of metadata from the application, which can be used to create data science models that can predict and detect potential security threats. MORF also looks into all previous versions of the application, bringing transparency to the security posture of the application. The tool boasts a user-friendly interface and an easy-to-use reporting system that makes it simple for hackers and security professionals to review and address any identified issues. With MORF, you can know that your mobile application's security is in good hands. Overall, MORF is a Swiss army knife for offensive mobile application security, as it saves a lot of time, increases efficiency, enables a data-driven approach, allows for transparency in the security posture of the application by looking into all previous versions, and minimizes the risk of data breaches related to sensitive information, all this by using heuristics-based techniques.

**Track:** Android, iOS and Mobile Hacking · Malware Defense · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Most Android hook ways aim at watching APIs for Java or Native code. However, some malicious apps try to escape hooking and access sensitive data using syscall directly, so it is crucial in order to uncover hidden code that some malicious apps use to bypass standard hooking techniques and access sensitive data directly through system calls. We have implemented a syscall hooking tool based on Seccomp-BPF named SSHook, which gives better balance between performance and compatibility. Seccomp-BPF was introduced into Linux kenel to filter syscalls and their arguments, we transform this security feature into a syscall hook framework which support devices range from Android 8.1 to Android 13. Our tool SSHook combined Seccomp-BPF with throwing an exception to catch syscall, and resuming instructions for normal execution by preparing additional threads earlier, which avoids frequent interruptions and possible risks like deadlocks, suspensions, or crashes. For performance improvement, we have implemented a flag that determines whether to resume execution using either the inactive parameter or the higher 4 bytes of an integer type, but the program can still run normally without any impact. Besides, SSHook is a lightweight framework but performs efficiently and robustly compared with other invasive or complicated solutions, which keep stable and reliable by standing on the shoulders of kernel features. SSHook can help to identify suspicious behavior in malicious Apps which abuse syscall to steal privacy files or collect sensitive data like MAC, applist, which can be integrated into sandbox environment to conduct more complete dynamic analysis. Furthermore, SSHook allows us to replace syscall arguments and bypass hooking tools to evade detection, which is particularly useful in preventing the collection of device fingerprints and protecting user privacy against tracking.

📝 **Description:** In November 2022, Kaspersky Lab publicly released research which outlined that reoccurring attacks against Microsoft SQL Server rose by 56% (https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_kaspersky-finds-reoccurring-attacks-using-microsoft-sql-server-rise-by-56-in-2022). I'd like to share a tool I wrote called SQLRecon, which will demonstrate how adversaries are leveraging Microsoft SQL services to facilitate with furthering their presence within enterprise networks through privilege escalation and lateral movement. I will also share defensive considerations which organizations can practically implement to mitigate attacks. I feel that this will add a fresh perspective on the various ancillary services within enterprise Windows networks which are under less scrutiny, however still ripe for abuse. For red team operators, SQLRecon helps address the post-exploitation tooling gap by modernizing the approach operators can take when attacking SQL Servers. The tool is written in C#, rather than long-standing existing tools that use PowerShell or Python. SQLRecon has been designed with operational security and detection avoidance in mind – with a special focus on stealth, reconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. The tool was designed to be modular, allowing for ease of extensibility from the hacker community. SQLRecon is compatible stand-alone or within a diverse set of command and control (C2) frameworks (Cobalt Strike, Nighthawk, Mythic, PoshC2, Sliver, Havoc, etc). When using the latter, SQLRecon can be executed either in-process, or through traditional fork and run. Furthermore, I will be releasing a new version, one that is currently only used internally on advanced red team engagements by IBM X-Force Red's Adversary Services team.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/tpope/vim-afterimage](https://github.com/tpope/vim-afterimage)  
📝 **Description:** Malicious IP addresses are critical indicators of cyber threats, and blocking these addresses is a standard practice during network forensics and incident response. Current solutions for maintaining anonymity, such as Tor nodes and botnets, have proven to be either compromised or illegal, thus posing challenges for legitimate red team exercises. In response to this growing demand for an effective solution, we have developed Afterimage, a novel application that enables attackers to enumerate and attack from multiple IP addresses without requiring the infrastructure of a botnet and with minimal time and effort. Afterimage operates as an intermediary, accepting malicious traffic from an attacker through an open port, forwarding it to a proxy, and ultimately to the victim. If the proxy's IP is blocked, the application automatically cycles to another proxy to continue sending traffic. This process is more efficient and secure than existing methods such as VPNs, which are often monitored and costly, or compromised solutions like Tor nodes and botnets. Our proposed solution, written in Python, is designed for deployment on remote servers, enabling multiple attackers to connect simultaneously. This unique approach to IP address cycling addresses key challenges faced during red team exercises, providing a more secure and effective solution for cyber security testing. By leveraging Afterimage, blue teams and SOCs can enhance their incident response capabilities and improve their overall cyber defense strategies.

📝 **Description:** The offensive industry is about exploring what's possible. Part of this is observing and taking lessons from other disciplines that have already solved a myriad of related challenges, from proper software engineering practices to using graph theory for offensive problems. But despite various leaps forward over the last several years, the offensive post-exploitation community has yet to fully embrace data analysis and enrichment pipelines beyond basic log aggregation and searching. If offensive tools were structured for automated processing instead of solely human consumption, we could unify post-ex data to exploit the known (and unknown) relationships within the data our offensive tools emit. Imagine a system that could ingest data from any C2 framework or post-ex tool, and could not just automate common operator tasks like binary analysis for known vulnerabilities and hash extraction and cracking of encrypted documents, but could perform complex offline analysis like host privilege escalation. If we could unify all post-exploitation data from offensive engagements we could improve operator workflows, provide tradecraft assistance, facilitate automation of onerous tasks, and uncover new data-driven research opportunities. A year ago, our team embarked on the development of just such a system, and we are excited to introduce the result of our effort: Nemesis.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/fkasler/cuddlephish](https://github.com/fkasler/cuddlephish)  
📝 **Description:** With the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication, traditional credential harvesting attacks are quickly losing effectiveness. Instead, redteamers have shifted focus away from credential harvesting and are now focussing on session hijacking attacks. Popular redteaming tools like Evilginx2 use transparent proxies to collect both credential AND session cookies from phishing targets. But what if the target service uses more advanced authentication flows like Oauth or SAML? What about apps that use JavaScript to directly thwart MitM attacks? Or even worse, services that don't grant authorization through session cookies at all? Our team has seen many instances of MitM protections like these, and in response, we are raising the bar for session hijacking tradecraft. Instead of using a transparent proxy, our solution leverages browser automation to force target users to log us into services for them. We don't just get to view the traffic. We get full control of an authenticated browser tab. Our solution, CuddlePhish, allows operators to bypass MFA even when MitM protections are in place, target multiple users simultaneously, key log users' credentials, trigger arbitrary javascript on victims' browsers to either redirect them or deliver payloads, and hijack not just session cookies, but authenticated browser tabs themselves. We have successfully used this attack against extremely difficult portals like Gmail and Lastpass.

📝 **Description:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a rapidly growing cloud infrastructure with millions of customers worldwide and more than a hundred of various products offered to them. While Cloud offers undeniable benefits in scalability, performance and security, it also opens new and unique challenges for security engineers working with Cloud. One such challenge is credential management. Cloud credentials such as GCP service account (SA) key can open access to the most critical parts of cloud infrastructure. An incorrectly stored or leaked SA key with such permissions represents high interest for an attacker. Security engineers need to understand the impact of such key leak/compromise to draft a proper security response. The main objective of GCP Scanner is to offer the community a tool that can be used to evaluate the security impact of a given cloud identity compromise. Security engineers can use this tool to assess the impact of a certain credentials leak, OAuth2 token, potential compromise of a GCP VM or Kubernetes pod. By now, the only option available was to rely on heavy-weight solutions or time-consuming manual analysis that require privileged access to the affected GCP organization. In contrast, the GCP Scanner works with individual credentials and offers an easy-to-use solution that can be executed from various types of environments with just a single command. In the demo, we will talk about the scanner architecture and show the audience on how to use the tool in various types of situations (leaked GCP service account key, compromised end-user credentials, VMs and Docker containers, standalone binary from any machine). We will also cover how the scanner can be used to evaluate whether a GCP SA key can be used to impersonate other service accounts and understand potential impact.

📝 **Description:** Konstellation is a new open-source tool that simplifies Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) data collection and security analysis. Kubernetes RBAC is a powerful tool to manage access to resources, but its complexity increases exponentially as principals and resources grow, making it challenging to analyze the resulting data at scale. Konstellation uses graph theory to map and analyze all Kubernetes resources and RBAC permissions, which simplifies analysis of RBAC implementations for security vulnerabilities. Konstellation allows engineers to understand what actions principals are allowed to perform on resources, analyze complex relationships not visible in native Kubernetes or other tools, and find overprovisioning and privilege escalation paths. Additionally, Konstellation is configuration-driven, allowing for quick adaptation to different environments, configurations, and analysis needs. The tool features three primary modes: enumeration, data ingestion, and querying. The enumeration mode connects directly to a Kubernetes cluster, enumerates each resource type returned by the API server, and writes the results to files in JSON format. Alternatively, Konstellation can ingest kubectl JSON output. Konstellation is schema-less and uses structured output from enumeration to determine data structures. Every resource instance and its attributes map into a Neo4j node with node properties. Users can query all enumerated resource data from the schema without data loss. After ingesting the resource instances, Konstellation maps relationships using Neo4j cypher queries defined in its configuration. Query mode allows for rapid data analysis. Konstellation ships with 40+ queries that look for privilege escalation paths and known vulnerable configurations. Users also can perform ad-hoc queries through command line or directly in Neo4j. Analyzing Kubernetes RBAC weaknesses at scale can be daunting, but Konstellation offers a clear overview of RBAC implementations and simplifies the process of identifying security vulnerabilities.

📝 **Description:** A lot of the initial steps in black box penetration testing involve information gathering using techniques such as port scanning. This information is then usually used for OSINT such as searching for known vulnerabilities for the found services and versions. Next steps often include searching for exploits for the found vulnerabilities. This process is inconvenient as it is often both labor and time intensive, both of which can often be a limiting factor for an engagement. Scanhanced solves this by providing an easy command line interface that can then perform the previously mentioned steps automatically, reducing both labor and time needed to minutes. It will perform a port scan, and then using that information attempt to find vulnerabilities and search community resources for exploits. Additionally, Scanhanced provides additional features such as identifying whether a given exploit is available in existing exploit frameworks, being able to download exploits, or download the vulnerable apps in question. Moreover, Scanhanced can produce output in JSON, XML, or CSV for use in further automation or ingestion into another tool if so desired. This entire process in addition to more complex functionality can be performed with an easy to use command and flags, saving pentesters time and from having to do tedious work.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/juneTome/SecScanC2](https://github.com/juneTome/SecScanC2)  
📝 **Description:** In the realm of security attack and defense, as well as penetration testing, two key challenges often arise. Firstly, attack scanning is frequently detected by defensive security systems, resulting in the scanning IP being blocked. Secondly, when defensive assets are controlled and connected back to the command and control (C2) server, security devices may detect the connection, leading to countermeasures against penetration testers. To address these challenges and enable safe, efficient asset detection and secure connections to controlled assets, we have enhanced the Kademlia protocol and developed a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology. Our hacking tool is highly effective during attack scanning, consisting of a large number of Internet nodes that dynamically update IDs and node tree structures at regular intervals. This approach allows each session to initiate requests from different nodes during the scanning process, thus avoiding IP blocking due to high-frequency scanning. Moreover, when connecting controlled assets back to the C2 server, nodes are randomly selected based on a user-defined hop count, effectively preventing penetration testers from being traced and significantly enhancing the stealthiness of the entire penetration testing process.

When each external function is referenced, it will jump to the middle stub function and retain the call information. If our security tool is killed by antivirus software, we can easily find the detection point of antivirus software based on the call information. Our security tool can detect its scanning rules in real time while antivirus software is running, so as to help you understand the behavior and rules of antivirus software. Our tool can detect antivirus software without disrupting its normal work, so as to help you better understand the behavior and rules of antivirus software.

The lucky security professionals work for companies who can afford expensive GRC tools to aide in managing risk. The unlucky majority out there usually end up spending countless hours managing risk via spreadsheets. It's cumbersome, time consuming, and just plain sucks. After starting a Risk Management program from scratch at a $1B/year company, Josh Sokol ran into these same barriers and where budget wouldn't let him go down the GRC route, he finally decided to do something about it. SimpleRisk is a simple and free tool to perform organizational Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance activities. Based entirely on open source technologies and sporting a Mozilla Public License 2.0, a SimpleRisk instance can be stood up in minutes and instantly provides the security professional with the ability to manage control frameworks, policies, and exceptions, facilitate audits, and perform risk prioritization and mitigation activities. It is highly configurable and includes dynamic reporting and the ability to tweak risk formulas on the fly. It is under active development with new features being added all the time. SimpleRisk is Enterprise Risk Management simplified.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/slrbl/unsupervised-learning-attack-detection-webhawk-catch](https://github.com/slrbl/unsupervised-learning-attack-detection-webhawk-catch)  
📝 **Description:** Webhawk/Catch helps automatically finding web attack traces in HTTP logs without using any preset rules. Based on the usage of Unsupervised Machine Learning, Catch groups log lines into clusters, and detects the outliers that it considers as potentially attack traces. The tool takes as input a raw HTTP log file (Apache, Nginx..) and returns a report with a list of findings. Catch uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) technique to select the most relevant features (Example: user-agent, IP address, number of transmitted parameters, etc.. ). Then, it runs DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to get all the possible log line clusters and anomalous points (potential attack traces). Advanced users can fine tune Catch based on a set of options that help optimising the clustering algorithm (Example: minimum number of points by cluster, or the maximum distance between two points within the same cluster). The current version of Webhawk/Catch generates an easy-to-read HTML report which includes all the findings, and the severity of each one.

**Track:** Network Defense · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang)  
📝 **Description:** Attacks on Identity and access systems are starting points for major data breaches achieved through privilege escalation and lateral movement. Identity-threat hunting reduces time needed to detect traces of an attacker so that the consequences of a breach can be controlled. Identity-threat hunting involves data collection from identity providers, normalization and application of analytics while navigating the rabbit holes of authentication flows across the systems. Kestrel is a threat hunting language that accelerates cyber threat hunting by providing a layer of abstraction to build reusable, composable, and shareable "hunt-flows", providing a great platform for identity-threat hunting. This arsenal session will showcase identity-threat hunting built on top of Kestrel. Starting with federated data retrieval from IAM systems using the OASIS Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) standard via OCA's STIX-shifter and lifting the results into an entity-relational data model. Then we will showcase analytic hunt steps besides data retrieval steps, walking you through the use case to hunt malicious activity in login data. To showcase the capability of kestrel and identity threat hunting, we use event data gathered from IBM Security Verify Identity and access management (IAM). The queries and analysis follow OASIS STIX standards. Our hunt book will work with any Identity provider that has a stix-shifter connector. The showcase uses a search for the IP address with multiple failed logins and later drills down and correlates with threat intel of known malicious activity for those IP addresses. The demo will also showcase the geographical distribution of those suspicious IP addresses, a list of applications which are accessed by these compromised IP addresses and accounts details of the logged-in user by IP address. Making it ready to try by the audience, we will demonstrate live hunts in Jupyter Notebooks. At the end of the session, we will introduce the kestrel-huntbook repo for people to reuse existing huntbooks and share their hunting knowledge with their colleagues and other hunters in the community

📝 **Description:** YAMA is a system for generating tools that can inspect whether specific malware is present in memory during incident response. While numerous security countermeasure products exist for malware detection, targeted attacks utilizing malware that operates only in memory remain challenging to detect using existing products and continue to pose a threat. Looking at existing open-source software (OSS) projects, some, such as PeSieve and Moneta, perform memory scans on live memory. However, few offer detection methods specifically tailored to particular malware for live systems. As file-less malware threats increase, having the means to verify the presence of malware in memory across multiple endpoints becomes crucial in incident response. Using our proposed YAMA system, the scanner generated can create memory scanners tailored explicitly to any malware. The scanner generated by YAMA is a standalone executable capable of running on most 64-bit Windows OS. When infection investigation of malware present only in memory is required during incident response, executing the scanner created by YAMA on the suspected device will easily detect whether it is infected. Furthermore, in cases where a large-scale infection is suspected, the scanner can be distributed via Active Directory (AD) to clarify the infection status within the network. YAMA is expected to be a powerful support tool for enhancing the investigative capabilities of Blue Teams, who conduct incident response daily.

**Track:** Hardware/Embedded · Smart Grid/Industrial Security · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/ZEEKRZERO/AutoSuite](https://github.com/ZEEKRZERO/AutoSuite)  
📝 **Description:** Vehicle buses such as FlexRay, LIN, CAN (FD) and Ethernet are the cornerstones of ECUs communication. At present, the security research of vehicle buses mainly focuses on CAN Bus. Due to the characteristics of the protocol itself, CAN data is usually transmitted within the domain. while Flexray is often used as a backbone network connecting powertrain control, autonomous driving, and body control domains for cross-domain communication and transmission of critical data. It is commonly used in high-end brands such as Audi, Lotus, and BMW. However, security research on Flexray is still in its infancy. We will present AutoSuite, an open-source, multi-protocol, low-cost vehicle bus testing framework, consisting of the AutoBox(hardware) and AutoFunc (software). AutoSuite can be used to access the FlexRay bus and simulate malicious ECUs to send forged data to realize cross-domain ECU attacks and discover potential security vulnerabilities. AutoBox is probably the first open-source, multi-protocol, low-cost vehicle bus testing hardware that support FlexRay. It can automatically analyze FlexRay bus configuration parameters, join the cluster, and send malicious data on the FlexRay bus. The hardware cost is about $200, which is much lower than the commercial FlexRay bus testing tool Vector VN8910 ($50k). AutoBox also supports remote control, multiple device collaboration, and Ethernet, LIN, and CAN (FD) protocols. AutoBox will provide a friendly, open-source, and low-cost testing tool for vehicle bus researchers, much like HACKRF has become a low-cost alternative to USRP. AutoFunc may be the first open-source software for functional-level communication testing and functional-level fuzzing that supports condition monitoring. Current open-source vehicle bus testing methods mainly rely on random fuzzing of the CAN protocol by using random data frame IDs, payloads, and DLC. However, a vehicle function typically involves multiple data frames, and a single data frame may not have any impact on the bus. With opendbc and other open-source projects, the .dbc file is no longer a commercial secret. AutoFunc can organize the frames defined in the .dbc file into specific functions, and monitor the function where the crash occurs to achieve a multi-protocol fuzzing test. In addition, we will show 2 demos, (1) Demonstrate all functions supported by AutoBox, such as FlexRay, CAN, LIN, Ethernet, WiFi, etc. (2) Functional-level fuzzing using AutoBox and AutoFunc.

**Track:** Internet Of Things · Hardware/Embedded · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/aslanding/clextract](https://github.com/aslanding/clextract)  
📝 **Description:** While satellite communication with ground stations can be eavesdropped on using consumer-grade products, the received signals are oftentimes highly corrupted and cannot be effectively decoded using the traditional finite-state machine (FSM) based approach. To this end, we develop a tool named CLExtract which utilizes contrastive learning techniques to decode and recover corrupted satellite streams. Unlike the traditional FSM-based approach which relies on critical fields that become unreliable after corruption, CLExtract directly learns the features of packet headers at different layers and identifies them in a stream sequence. By filtering out these headers, CLExtract extracts the innermost payload which contains sensitive and private data. Further, CLExtract incorporates data augmentation techniques to entitle the trained contrastive learning models with robustness against unseen forms of corruption. To evaluate CLExtract, we performed eavesdropping on the spectrum range from 11 GHZ to 12.75 GHZ in a suburban area of a metropolis with more than 10 million of population in Asia, covering radio signals from seven commercial satellites. CLExtract can successfully decode and recover 71-99% of the total 23.6GB eavesdropped data, a significant improvement over the traditional FSM-based approach implemented by GSExtract which only recovers 2%. During the arsenal presentation, we will make CLExtract open source and demonstrate its usage to the security community using real-world satellite streams. This way, we hope to foster future research on satellite offense and defense techniques.

📝 **Description:** Many Enterprises are shifting away from dedicated workstations and cubes, and moving to a more flexible workspace with thin client and desk hoteling. This creates the ideal landscape for hardware implant attacks. The current implant market, as it exists today, has not kept up with this shift. While closed source for-profit solutions exist, by their nature they lack the flexibility and customization to adapt to large scale targeted deployments. Open source projects similarly exist but focus more on individual workstations (dumb keyboards and remote terminals) relying on corporate networks for remote control and are easily detectable. Neither solution today is able to meet the needs of a modern Red Team. This presentation introduces an open source, freely available hardware implant which adopts modern IoT technologies, leveraging non-standard communication channels to create a remotely managed mesh network of hardware implants. Attendees will learn about the new techniques and tactics that we used to create a new breed of open-source hardware implant. Topics covered in this presentation will include the scaling of implants for a stealthy enterprise takeover, creating and utilizing a flexible command and control mesh network, creating a new class of remote access shells that survive idle screen lock, and more. Attendees will leave the talk with new tactics and a new platform from which to innovate their own custom implants from. Live demos will be used to demonstrate these new tactics against real world infrastructure. Previous hardware implant talks have covered: basic implants, their benefits, injecting keystrokes, Wi-Fi connectivity, and attack scripts. This presentation builds off of those but shows attendees how to leverage new techniques and technologies to push the innovation of hardware implants forward evolutionarily for use in today's modern Red Team operations.

**Track:** Hardware/Embedded · Malware Defense · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/FA-PengFei/OOBAVD_Pub](https://github.com/FA-PengFei/OOBAVD_Pub)  
📝 **Description:** USB-based attacks account for more than 52% of all cybersecurity attacks on operational technology (OT) systems in the industrial control systems (ICS) industry. The discovery of Stuxnet in 2015 served as a stark reminder that even air-gapped computers, previously thought to be impervious to cyberattacks, are vulnerable. These systems are found in secure military organizations or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The societal impact of such attacks can be enormous. Stuxnet, for example, caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear programs and facilities. While air-gapped systems are considered "secure," they are inconvenient for computer operators, particularly when performing updates and transferring data, which require the use of mobile storage devices, such as USB sticks. Unfortunately, this introduces a flaw into the air-gapped systems, exposing them to computer viruses and malware. Furthermore, adding new peripherals to these systems, such as keyboards and mice, allows BadUSB attacks to be carried out. OOBAVD is a solution to close this gap. OOBAVD acts as a intermediary between the air-gapped system and USB devices, scanning and blocking detected malicious files from the air-gapped system. Furthermore, malware can attack commercial software-based antivirus software on the host machine by blocking, corrupting, and replacing core antivirus engine files, rendering them inoperable and defenseless. OOBAVD being out of band in the transfer process, is mitigated from this risk. OOBAVD is designed to have minimum software pre-installed, which reduces the attack surface area to be infected by malware. OOBAVD can also be wiped clean and flashed before connecting to new air-gapped computers, removing persistent malware that manages to infect OOBAVD.

<details><summary><strong>Puppet Fuzz: Discovering Critical Kernel Vulnerabilities with Innovative Approach</strong> — Siqi Chen, Minghang Shen, Chunyang Han, Xin Wang</summary>

**Track:** Hardware/Embedded · Exploitation and Ethical Hacking · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become an integral part of our lives, but their security vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to our privacy and security. While previous research has focused on user space components of embedded firmware, we have discovered that kernel vulnerabilities in these complex devices are particularly high-risk, potentially leading to full system compromise. Kernel modules are typically tightly bound to the kernel, but because different IoT devices use different kernel versions and compile options, it is difficult to load them correctly in other simulated environments. However, true device-based fuzz testing is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, unlike user-level programs, kernel-level programs require a device reboot after every crash, which further limits the development of IoT kernel fuzz testing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that abstracts closed-source kernel modules code to execute on a stable Linux kernel environment that we have constructed by using our aspect oriented system. This platform allows us to transfer library function calls and stack management, enabling us to detect kernel-level vulnerabilities that were previously difficult to identify. In addition, due to our front-end and back-end separation design, the platform can easily support IoT drivers of multiple architectures. Our approach has enabled us to discover a multitude of issues across devices from top manufacturers such as Netgear, Cisco, Asus, HP,TPLink,DLink and Western Digital etc. In this talk, we will show our method and present one such universal kernel hardware module vulnerability, demonstrating how we were able to exploit a kernel driver vulnerability to achieve remote command execution on the device. Our platform provides a replicable and stable environment that forms the basis for efficient and effective kernel fuzz testing, ultimately improving the security of IoT devices and protecting the privacy of their users.

<details><summary><strong>Safe Scan&C2 Tool</strong> — Weichao Zhou</summary>

**Track:** Internet Of Things · Hardware/Embedded · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** In the process of security attack and defense, as well as penetration testing, there are two prominent issues. First, the attack scanning is often detected by the security systems of the defense side, resulting in the scanning IP being blocked. Second, when the defense side is controlled and assets are connected back to the command and control (C2) server, it may be detected by security devices, leading to countermeasures against the penetration testers. In order to safely and conveniently conduct asset detection during the attack and defense process, as well as secure connection back to the controlled assets on the defense side, we have improved the Kademlia protocol and developed a distributed hash table (DHT) technology. We have also developed a networking tool that consists of a large number of Internet nodes, which dynamically updates IDs and node tree structures at regular intervals. This allows each session to initiate requests from a different node during the scanning process, preventing IP blocking due to high-frequency scanning. Additionally, during the controlled asset's connection back to the C2 server, nodes are randomly selected based on user-selected hop count, effectively preventing penetration testers from being traced, thus improving the penetration testing process.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/JoelGMSec/Thunderstorm](https://github.com/JoelGMSec/Thunderstorm)  
📝 **Description:** One of the main premises of any IT installation, is to protect the entire infrastructure against possible failures. In addition to firewalls and other network elements, one of the vital points is the electrical system. Thanks to uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), it is possible to cover and manage these issues economically. The main problem, is that many of these systems inherit the same bugs as other IoT devices, which makes them vulnerable to all kinds of attacks. In this presentation, we will explain how it has been possible to develop different zero-day vulnerabilities thanks to social engineering, some investment, and a bit of common sense. Among other things, these flaws would make it possible to compromise the electrical system of an office or even that of a Data Center. Since these devices share common components, it would be possible to obtain remote code execution (with the highest possible privileges) and/or denial of service on more than 100 different manufacturers. Moreover, all of this has been automated in a single framework, making it possible to detect and exploit these vulnerabilities easily, simply and fully automatically.

<details><summary><strong>Glyph - An Architecture Independent Binary Analysis Tool for Fingerprinting Functions Through NLP</strong> — Corey Hartman</summary>

**Track:** Reverse Engineering · **Event:** USA 2023  
🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/Xenios91/Glyph](https://github.com/Xenios91/Glyph)  
📝 **Description:** Reverse engineering is an important task performed by security researchers to identify vulnerable functions and malicious functions in IoT (Internet of Things) devices that are often shared across multiple devices of many system architectures. Common techniques to currently identify the reuse of these functions do not perform cross-architecture identification unless specific data such as unique strings are identified that may be of use in identifying a piece of code. Utilizing natural language processing techniques, Glyph allows you to upload an ELF binary (32 & 64 bit) for cross-architecture function fingerprinting, upon analysis, a web-based function symbol table will be created and presented to the user to aid in their analysis of binary executables/shared objects.

🔗 **Link:** [https://github.com/Bw3ll/sharem](https://github.com/Bw3ll/sharem)  
📝 **Description:** Shellcode can be cryptic, especially when encoded. Understanding its functionality is not straightforward. SHAREM is a cutting-edge Shellcode Analysis Framework, with both emulation and its own disassembler. SHAREM's unprecedented capabilities can allow us to unravel the mysteries of shellcode in new ways not seen. Windows syscalls have become trendy in offensive security, yet SHAREM is the only tool that can emulate and log all user-mode Windows syscalls. Additionally, SHAREM also emulates and logs thousands of WinAPI functions. SHAREM is the only shellcode tool to parse and discover not only parameters, but also entire structures passed as parameters. SHAREM doesn't present parameters as hexadecimal values, but converts each to human readable format, in vivid colors. Disassemblers like IDA Pro and Ghidra can be poor at disassembling shellcode accurately. SHAREM's disassembler is significantly more accurate with its original analysis capabilities. SHAREM additionally can uniquely integrate emulation results to provide flawless disassembly. Novel signature identifications are used to identify each function in the shellcode, and parameter values. SHAREM uses unique capabilities to accurately identify data, presenting data the correct way, not as misinterpreted instructions. SHAREM also uniquely provides complete-code coverage via emulation, capturing all functionality. New at Arsenal, we will release a new script that allows SHAREM's output to be ingested by Ghidra. While Ghidra can handle shellcode in some cases, it simply cannot beat a framework specifically designed to handle and emulate shellcode. As such, this new release leverages SHAREM's advanced capabilities. Additionally, major updates include revamped complete-code coverage, timeless debugging of stack, nearly doubling the number of supported WinAPIs. SHAREM provides unprecedented capabilities with encoded shellcode. Not only does it fully deobfuscate shellcode through emulation, discovering WinAPIs and syscalls, but it automatically recovers the shellcode's deobfuscated form. SHAREM presents error-free disassembly of its decoded form, with function calls and parameters labelled.
