  "Description": "ThreatPatrol is a powerful open-source SaaS tool that offers Blue Teams a wealth of information on potential threats, allowing them to gain situational awareness and perform threat hunting. The tool's flexibility is a significant advantage, as it can be hosted on the cloud or on an internal standalone machine, providing users with the convenience and customisation options they need.\n\nThreatPatrol offers a comprehensive database of over 160 threat actor groups, indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and their modus operandi out of the box. This information is regularly updated to ensure that users have access to the latest information on potential threats, providing insights into emerging threats and enabling proactive measures to prevent cyber-attacks.\n\nCyber Defenders can add, update, or degrade TTPs and IOCs for their network and map them to the MITRE Framework, which can be visualised on the dashboard in graph form, and generate reports for sharing with executive members. By proactively collecting and analysing data on potential threats, cyber teams can improve their situational awareness, enabling them to take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate attacks.\n\nThreatPatrol also provides feeds from over 100+ different sources, allowing organisations to stay up-to-date with the latest attack methods and trends, adjust their security posture, and protect themselves better against cyber threats. With improved situational awareness, organisations can respond more quickly and effectively when incidents occur, making ThreatPatrol an essential tool for protecting valuable data and avoiding the devastating consequences of a cyber-attack.",
