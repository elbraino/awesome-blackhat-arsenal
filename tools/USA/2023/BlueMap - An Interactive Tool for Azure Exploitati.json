  "Description": "As demonstrated in BlackHat UK & Asia - BlueMap helps cloud red teamers and security researchers identify IAM misconfigurations, information gathering, and abuse of managed identities in interactive mode without ANY third-party dependencies. No more painful installations on the customer's environment, and No more need to custom the script to avoid SIEM detection!\n\nThe tool leaves minimum traffic in the network logs to help during red team engagements from on-prem to the cloud. Developed in Python and implemented all Azure integrations from scratch with zero dependencies on Powershell stuff. The idea behind the tool is to let security researchers and red team members have the ability to focus on more Opsec rather than DevOps stuff.",
