  "Description": "SCodeScanner is a powerful tool for identifying vulnerabilities in source-code. It is designed to be easy to use and provides a range of features to help users quickly and accurately identify vulnerabilities with fewer false positives.\n\nSome key features of SCodeScanner include:\n\n- Support multiple languages: SCodeScanner is capable of scanning source code written in multiple languages such as JAVA, PHP and YAML. The most commonly used languages in web development.\n\n- Relatively Less false positives: SCodeScanner includes flags that help to eliminate false positives and only report on vulnerabilities that are mostly confirmed to exist.\n\n- Custom rules: SCodeScanner works with semgrep and allows users to create their own rules to scan for advanced patterns.\n\n- Ability to track user input variables: SCodeScanner can identify instances where user input variables are defined in one file but used insecurely in another file for better coverage.\n\n- Fast scanning: SCodeScanner's rules are designed to check for multiple vulnerabilities at once, which results in a faster scanning process.\n\n- Integration: SCodeScanner can integrate with CI/CD pipelines and also pass results to bug-tracking services such as Jira and Slack, allowing users to easily share the results of their scans with their team.\n\n- Scan mutltiple ways: It automatically download all git repo mentioned inside a txt file and start scan. Not only this but also support git, folder, file scans aswell.\n\nProof of results, SCodeScanner has already found 5 vulnerabilities in multiple Wordpress plugins and has been awarded following CVEs:\n\nCVE-2022-1604\nCVE-2022-1465\nCVE-2022-1474\nCVE-2022-1527\nCVE-2022-1532\n\nOverall, SCodeScanner is a valuable tool for any developer or security professional looking to identify vulnerabilities in their source-code before it is published in production. Its fast scanning, less false positives, and CI/CD pipeline integrations as well as bug-tracking services, make it a powerful tool for ensuring the security of your code.",
