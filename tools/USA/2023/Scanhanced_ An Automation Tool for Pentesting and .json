  "Description": "A lot of the initial steps in black box penetration testing involve information gathering using techniques such as port scanning. This information is then usually used for OSINT such as searching for known vulnerabilities for the found services and versions. Next steps often include searching for exploits for the found vulnerabilities. This process is inconvenient as it is often both labor and time intensive, both of which can often be a limiting factor for an engagement.\nScanhanced solves this by providing an easy command line interface that can then perform the previously mentioned steps automatically, reducing both labor and time needed to minutes. It will perform a port scan, and then using that information attempt to find vulnerabilities and search community resources for exploits. Additionally, Scanhanced provides additional features such as identifying whether a given exploit is available in existing exploit frameworks, being able to download exploits, or download the vulnerable apps in question. Moreover, Scanhanced can produce output in JSON, XML, or CSV for use in further automation or ingestion into another tool if so desired.\nThis entire process in addition to more complex functionality can be performed with an easy to use command and flags, saving pentesters time and from having to do tedious work.",
