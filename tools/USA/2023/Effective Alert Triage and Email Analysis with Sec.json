  "Description": "In this workshop, we will explore the integration of two cutting-edge free and open platforms: Security Onion, a versatile solution for threat hunting, enterprise security monitoring, and log management; and Sublime Platform, an innovative open email security platform designed to prevent email attacks such as BEC, malware, and credential phishing. Sublime Platform's unique domain-specific language (DSL) enables detection-as-code, allowing for highly customizable email security detection.\n\nAttendees will learn how to:\n\n1. Set up and configure the integration between Security Onion and Sublime Platform, leveraging the combined strength of these tools to detect, prevent, triage, and enrich email threats.\n2. Utilize Sublime Platform's DSL for detection-as-code, crafting tailored rules and policies to identify and prevent a wide range of email threats.\n3. Effectively triage Sublime email alerts within Security Onion, streamlining incident response and reducing the time needed to identify and remediate threats.\n4. Pivot to Sublime for in-depth investigation and analysis of suspicious emails, extracting valuable context and indicators to inform security decisions.\n5. Enrich and correlate Sublime alerts with other data sources in Security Onion, such as Zeek HTTP/DNS/TLS records, Suricata alerts, and full PCAP to answer questions with network metadata such as: Did the user click on the link? Has anyone ever visited this domain or link before? And more.\n\nBy combining Security Onion's robust capabilities with Sublime Platform's innovative approach to email security, participants will gain hands-on experience in creating a comprehensive defense against email-based attacks.\n\nEquip yourself with the knowledge and tools needed to combat the evolving landscape of email threats by attending this workshop, and take advantage of these powerful, free solutions to bolster your organization's defenses.",
