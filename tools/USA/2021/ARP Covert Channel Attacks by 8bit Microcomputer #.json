  "Description": "Introduces a method of embedding information in the padding part of ARP and performing secret communication with only one small 8-bit microcomputer. The transmitter uses an 8-bit microcomputer called Atmega328P. A 10BASE-T Ethernet frame is generated using only the GPIO of the microcomputer without using a dedicated chip such as an Ethernet controller. By using this method, it is possible to perform a covert channel attack with a smaller and cheaper method than the conventional method.",
