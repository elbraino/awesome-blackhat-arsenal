  "Description": "During the last years, hardware implants have become a popular attack vector in air-gapped environments such as industrial networks: Stuxnet (2010), Operation Copperfield (2017), and the recent ransomware attack that has led to a shutdown in a US natural gas facility are only some notable cases. In parallel, in an effort to raise the bar of red-teaming operations, security researchers have been designing and releasing powerful open-source devices with the intent to make Red-Teaming operations even more interesting and disruptive. Smoothing the path to new TTPs and improving old ones. As a result, hardware implants should always be included in the threat modeling of an industrial facility.\n\nDuring this talk, after a bit of history of hardware implants, will be presented a new hacking device: USBsamurai. A remotely-controlled USB HID injecting cable that costs less than 15 USD to produce from off-the-shelf components (a cable and a USB radio transceiver) that can be used to compromise targets remotely (i.e. over a 2.4GHz undetectable protocol) in the stealthiest way ever seen & also bypass Air-Gapped Environments like a boss!\n\nThis presentation will be quite technical, tailored for an ICS security audience. Come to this talk to start preparing for the next wave of attacks that can pass undetected by most of the existing security solutions available on the market.\n\nFinally, I'll conclude the talk with practical, actionable countermeasures to prevent and detect HID attacks, and conclude by explaining how to approach a forensics analysis in presence of USB implants.",
