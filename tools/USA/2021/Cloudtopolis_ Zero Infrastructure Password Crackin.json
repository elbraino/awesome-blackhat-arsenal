  "Description": "Cloudtopolis is a tool that facilitates the installation and provisioning of Hashtopolis on the Google Cloud Shell platform, quickly and completely unattended (and also, free!). Together with Google Collaboratory, it allows us to break hashes without the need for dedicated hardware from any browser (even from your smartphone).\n\nThanks to its implementation through Docker, it can be run almost anywhere in a fast and easy way. In addition, it can be used collaboratively using different accounts, being very useful for use in CTF teams or in Red Team exercises.\n\nAs a novelty in this talk, automated clients for Windows and Linux (not disclosed yet) will be presented, being able to additionally use the user's local resources together with the graphic cards provided by Colab.",
