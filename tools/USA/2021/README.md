<details><summary><strong>Introducing subCrawl: A Framework for the Analysis and Clustering of Hacking Tools Found Using Open Directories</strong></summary>

![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming-red) ![Josh Stroschein](https://img.shields.io/badge/Josh%20Stroschein-informational) ![Patrick Schläpfer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Patrick%20Schläpfer-informational)

📝 **Description:** From phishing kits to command-and-control panels, web shells and multiple samples of malware, open directories can provide a wealth of information into threat actor operations. But how can we discover open directories? And once we discover them, what are the next steps for identifying interesting content?

To answer these questions, we created the open-source framework subCrawl. subCrawl is written in Python3 and provides a modular framework for discovering open directories, unique content through signatures and organizing the data with optional output modules, such as MISP.

Open directories are simply folders that are viewable on a public web server that provides direct links to all its content. While open directories can be used to legitimately share files, they are often overlooked by threat actors. Therefore, they can provide insight into the structure, tools and malware being used by many threat actors. This oversight can provide direct access to the tools they've placed on a server, such as web shells, C2 panels or proxy scripts.

To organize the data, we use our framework subCrawl to aggregate the data with fuzzy hashes, web server information, used scripting languages and more. This approach allows for the creation of signatures that can be used to track tool usage across multiple hosts and cluster threat actor activities. To help manage the hosts explored and the data collected, we create consolidated MISP events, which enables us to cluster the found artifacts and draw interesting conclusions about the use of tools.

We will present the open-source framework subCrawl, which reflects our approach for hunting open directories. We will also explore our methodology to detect and cluster malicious content using publicly available threat feeds with the support of the well-known tool MISP, which helps us to store the data in a structured form and cluster it.

📝 **Description:** Penetration testing is an effective means of discovering vulnerabilities and inadequate settings in the overall system, and of investigating whether there are any operational security risks. However, in manual penetration testing, there are many cases where it is unclear whether the test content is really appropriate, because the diagnosis varies depending on the tester's strong and weak, interests, physical condition, and mental state on that day. Also, excellent testers are already booked by a large amount of work, and it is not always possible to request them without fail. In addition, cyber attacks on ICS (Industrial Control System) have been increasing recently, especially in 2020, when there were many cases of ransomware infections that caused damage to ICS. Furthermore, the number of reports of ICS vulnerabilities is increasing every year. In response to this situation, penetration testing for ICS has been attracting much attention.

In this work, we developed Mushikago, an automatic penetration testing tool using game AI, which focuses on the verification of post-exploit among penetration tools. A post-exploit is an attack that an attacker carries out after entering the target environment. By focusing on post-exploit verification, we can understand how far an attacker can actually penetrate and what kind of information is collected. Mushikago uses the GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), which is game AI commonly used in NPC (Non Player Character). To using Mushikago, we can flexibly change the content of the attack according to the environment and mimic the attacks conducted by actual APT attackers and testers. It is also possible to identify terminal information, account information, and network information without manual intervention, and visualize and report them based on MITRE ATT&CK. In addition, Mushikago supports ICS, and can be used for penetration testing across IT and OT (Operation Technology).

🔗 **Link:** [PyRDP: Remote Desktop Protocol Monster-in-the-Middle (MITM)](https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp/blob/main/pyproject.toml)  
📝 **Description:** PyRDP is a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) monster-in-the-middle (MITM) tool and library useful in intrusion testing and malware research. Its out of the box offensive capabilities can be divided in three broad categories: client-side, MITM-side and server-side. On the client-side PyRDP can actively steal any clipboard activity, crawl mapped drives and collect all keystrokes. On the MITM-side PyRDP records everything on the wire in several formats (logs, JSON events), allows the attacker to take control of an active session and performs a pixel perfect recording of the RDP screen. On the server-side, on-logon PowerShell or cmd injection can be performed when a legitimate client connects.

On the malware research side, PyRDP can be used as part of a fully interactive honeypot. It can be placed in front of a Windows RDP server to intercept malicious sessions. It can replace the credentials provided in the connection sequence with working credentials to accelerate compromise and malicious behavior collection. It also saves a visual and textual recording of each RDP session, which is useful for investigation or to generate IOCs. Additionally, PyRDP saves a copy of the files that are transferred via the drive redirection feature, allowing it to collect malicious payloads.

Over the last year, we implemented several features that we are going to uncover in this brand-new arsenal workshop: improved file interception and crawling, dynamic certificate cloning, CredSSP/NLA support with private certificate and key, dynamic NLA redirection, NTLMSSP hash logging, and more.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** The famous DEFCON CTF is one of the thousands Capture the Flag (CTFs) contests that, since many years, have become the "lifeblood" of the cybersecurity community. CTF players reverse-engineer vulnerable services in traditional IT applications (like web and binary) to score points.

Given the increased adoption of wireless-connected devices and pervasive, interconnected networks of so-called "IoT systems," since 2018 our teams of researchers have been promoting an RF-specific version of traditional CTFs, in which contestants are asked to reverse engineer radio-based protocols as opposed to traditional network communications. We called our contest the Capture the Signal (CTS) (https://www.trendmicro.com/cts/). This activity is also known as "blind signal analysis" as the signals' specification are unknown to the attacker. Each radio signal corresponds to a challenge. The challenges are organized by difficulty levels, and each solved challenge unlocks the next one. In other words, the flag concealed in each signal represents the clue to the next radio signal (e.g., the tuning frequency or any other radio parameters). The more points are scored, the closer the contestant is to win.

In normal circumstances, we've hosted the game on site at conferences world-wide, where radio signals are distributed "over the air", and participant are asked to use software-defined radio equipment to interact with the challenges. However, due the diverse local regulations in terms of wireless transmissions, we designed and implemented a containerized solution that eliminates the complexity of deploying physical radio transmitters, using an RF-over-IP broadcasting technique instead. With this framework, we can easily deploy CTS contests in countries with strict wireless regulation and remotely, backed by any cloud provider that offer container services.

🔗 **Link:** [Falco + Falcosidekick = A Kubernetes Response Engine](https://github.com/developer-guy/awesome-falco)  
📝 **Description:** Falco is the CNCF open-source project for runtime threat detection for containers and Kubernetes. It was created by Sysdig in 2016 and is the first runtime security project to join CNCF as an incubation-level project.

Falco is a container security tool designed to detect anomalous activity in your local machine, container, cloud, a managed Kubernetes cluster, or a Kubernetes cluster such as K3s. It taps into system calls and Kubernetes Audit logs to generate an event stream of all system activity.

One of the benefits of Falco is in leveraging its powerful and flexible rules language. As a result, Falco will generate security events when it finds abnormal behaviors as defined by a customizable set of rules. Meanwhile, Falco comes with a handful of out-of-the-box detection rules.

The Falco community is strong and active, contributing largely to not only the project but methods in which folks can find threats and feed whatever method they choose with examples! Falcosidekick was born providing an easy to use UI to Falco and an enhanced available outputs. Falcosidekick even provides a response engine utilizing serverless (lambda, knative, kubeless, openfaas) which extends capabilities to whatever the security team wants to create remediation functions for with examples such as stopping a container, memdump, etc etc.

<details><summary><strong>HOOKA: Deep Dive Into ART(Android Runtime) For Dynamic Binary Analysis</strong></summary>

![Category: Others](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Others-lightgrey) ![Seong Hyun Song](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seong%20Hyun%20Song-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [HOOKA: Deep Dive Into ART(Android Runtime) For Dynamic Binary Analysis](https://gist.github.com/standardgalactic/7f03809c56f4b098b95a50ada32cd02c)  
📝 **Description:** Google has changed Android runtime drastically each time a new version of Android is released to optimize the performance, storage usage, and system updates of apps. The profiling data has started to be generated in the recent version of Android 10, based on the user's behavior in ART (Android Runtime). Based on the profiling data, the byte code is optimized (Profile-Guided optimization and Cloud Profile optimization) by the compiler (AOT/JIT). ART also interprets and executes different types of code (byte code, oat code, and jit code) generated by the compiler. Such complexity in the structure and the operation method makes ART difficult to understand correctly. However, since all the code of the app is interpreted and executed through ART, if the attacker understands how ART works, it is possible to steal all the information necessary to analyze the app. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the flow and structure of how the app code is interpreted and executed by objects existing in Android 10 ART. Then, by modifying the ART based on the analysis results, we develop a framework that can steal the information in real-time, such as smali code, interface, parameters, return value, fields, and stack trace of a method that is executed dynamically. In addition, we present an easy technique to effectively analyze the app without accessing the execution code by using tools such as decompiler or disassembler.

In existing debugger or hooking frameworks that dynamically analyze the apps in the Android environment, it is forcibly attached to the target analysis process, and the code is injected to read or analyze the code in the memory area while the execution code is loaded in memory. Since these methods are blocked by RASP (Runtime Application Self Protection), it takes a lot of time for attackers or analysts to bypass it and analyze the app.

The method proposed in this paper, on the other hand, analyzes the app by modifying the ART (Android Runtime) itself which is responsible for loading and executing the app's execution code in memory in Android. Even if any Anti-Hooking and Anti-Debugging techniques are applied to the app, all the codes are eventually executed through ART. This allows us to dump the dynamically executed code as smali code without being detected by RASP. In addition, all runtime information (such as stack trace, args, return value, etc.) of running functions can be captured and used for the analysis.

This technique is basically to redevelop ART in Android. Most similar methods that change the system modules in Android build the Android OS in debug mode. This makes such approach with the system modification more easily detectable by RASP.
However, the method proposed in this presentation bypasses AVB (Android Verified Boot) and SafetyNet in the kernel, and then patch only the ART module from Stock Rom released by Google. Therefore, I present an effective method to easily analyze apps without being detected by RASP.

📝 **Description:** Ipa-medit is a memory search and patch tool for resigned ipa without jailbreaking. It was created for mobile game security testing.

Memory modification is the easiest way to cheat in games, it is one of the items to be checked in the security test. There are also cheat tools that can be used casually like GameGem and iGameGuardian on iOS. However, there were no tools available for un-jailbroken device. So I made it as a security testing tool.

There is an android version of the tool, apk-medit(https://github.com/aktsk/apk-medit), that I created.

Many mobile games have jailbreak detection, but ipa-medit does not require jailbreaking, so memory modification can be done without bypassing the jailbreak detection.

🔗 **Link:** [Solitude: A Privacy Analysis Tool](https://github.com/earthspecies/audio-embeddings/blob/main/02_simple_rnn.ipynb)  
📝 **Description:** Solitude is an open-source privacy analysis tool that aims to help people inspect where their private data goes once it leaves their favorite mobile or web applications. Whether a curious novice or a more advanced researcher, Solitude makes the process of evaluating an app's privacy accessible for everyone.

Unfortunately, privacy policies are often difficult to understand when trying to identify how your private data is being shared and whom it's being shared with. As we have seen through research, privacy policies don't always tell the complete truth of what an apps actual data collection practices are. Solitude was built to help give more transparency to users of where their private data
goes. Solitude makes the process of proxying HTTP traffic and searching through HTTP traffic more straightforward. Solitude can be configured to look for any type of data that you input in a mobile or web application and reveal where that data is going. The application inspects all outbound HTTP traffic, looks for various hashes of your data and recursively decodes common encoding schemes (base64,URL).

📝 **Description:** During the last years, hardware implants have become a popular attack vector in air-gapped environments such as industrial networks: Stuxnet (2010), Operation Copperfield (2017), and the recent ransomware attack that has led to a shutdown in a US natural gas facility are only some notable cases. In parallel, in an effort to raise the bar of red-teaming operations, security researchers have been designing and releasing powerful open-source devices with the intent to make Red-Teaming operations even more interesting and disruptive. Smoothing the path to new TTPs and improving old ones. As a result, hardware implants should always be included in the threat modeling of an industrial facility.

During this talk, after a bit of history of hardware implants, will be presented a new hacking device: USBsamurai. A remotely-controlled USB HID injecting cable that costs less than 15 USD to produce from off-the-shelf components (a cable and a USB radio transceiver) that can be used to compromise targets remotely (i.e. over a 2.4GHz undetectable protocol) in the stealthiest way ever seen & also bypass Air-Gapped Environments like a boss!

This presentation will be quite technical, tailored for an ICS security audience. Come to this talk to start preparing for the next wave of attacks that can pass undetected by most of the existing security solutions available on the market.

Finally, I'll conclude the talk with practical, actionable countermeasures to prevent and detect HID attacks, and conclude by explaining how to approach a forensics analysis in presence of USB implants.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Cloud Sniper is a platform designed to manage Cloud Security Operations, intended to respond to security incidents by accurately analyzing and correlating cloud artifacts. It is meant to be used as a Cloud Security Operations platform to detect and remediate security incidents by showing a complete visibility of the company's cloud security posture.

It introduces a centralized Incident and Response platform, which executes automatic actions, by learning from the analysts' expert knowledge. To do it, only native cloud artifacts and open source technologies are implemented. In this way, the community can extend the project with different security use cases.

Cloud Sniper receives and processes security feeds, providing an automatic response mechanism to protect the cloud infrastructure. To detect attackers' advanced TTPs, Cloud Sniper Analytics module correlates IOCs providing enhanced security findings to the security analyst.

With this platform, you get a complete and comprehensive management system of the security incidents. At the same time, an advanced security analyst can integrate Cloud Sniper with external forensic or incident-and-response tools to ingest new security feeds. The platform automatically deploys and provides cloud-based integration with all native resources, in a fully modularized manner, making it very easy to extend for the community.

Cloud Sniper introduces an analytics module to analyze data, metrics and telemetry generated on the cloud. This first version analyzes VPC flows to detect beaconing patterns.

As part of the platform, we have developed two modules to complement it:

* Cloud Droid (Incident and Response Simulations): Currently, incident and response teams develop different mechanisms to detect attacks, leaving aside the testing phase. Although each automation is tested before implementation, it is not constantly monitored. Droid proposes an automated testing model in which controlled actions are expected to be triggered to perform security incident simulations.

* Cloud Lusat (Internal Threat Intelligence Feeds, Inventory and Compliance Data Collection): It aims to process information based on threat intelligence feeds, generate an inventory and check the compliance of different cloud resources.

🔗 **Link:** [LUDA: Large URLs Dataset Analyzer for Security](https://github.com/akamai/luda)  
📝 **Description:** What interesting stuff can we find by looking only at URLs without the actual HTTP traffic ?

Well, quite a lot. Hackers often do not reinvent the wheel. They buy existing malwares or phishing that use the same scheme for HTTP communication. Techniques to randomize URLs , like DGA, often apply on the domain part". But what about the rest?

In this talk, we present LUDA - Large URLs Dataset Analyzer for security. It works in two modes: Malware or Phishing.
The first will detect similarities between C2 communication and cluster them by families. The last will apply the same clustering with an additional layer of " brand " detection.
Both of them can automatically extract regexes, using Genetic algorithm, and can be deployed for inline detections.
This powerful tool already supports integration with various public malicious repositories like PhishTank, URLHaus , Virus Total as well as dozens more.
As opposed to similar projects , this tool is focused only on security. It includes specific options like automatic false positive cleaning.
We will demo how we can run LUDA on public datasets with the two modes and show how it succeeds to get quality insights from large datasets. Finally we will show what are the current threat families found on real traffic data taken from Akamai Secure Web Gateway.

🔗 **Link:** [Slips: A Machine-Learning Based, Free-Software, Network Intrusion Prevention System](https://github.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS)  
📝 **Description:** Slips is a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free software to use machine learning to detect attacks in the network. It is a modular system that profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections in time windows. Slips' modules detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected device. Slips connects to other Slips using P2P, and exports alerts to other systems.

Slips works in several directionality modes. The concept of home network is not used to choose which detection to apply, but to choose which profile to analyze. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network.

Among its modules, Slips includes the download/manage of external Threat Intelligence feed (including our laboratory's own TI feed), whois/asn/geocountry enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scanning detection (vertical and horizontal) on flows, long connection detection, etc. The decisions to block profiles or not are based on ensembling
algorithms. The P2P module connects to other Slips to share detection alerts.

Slips can read packets from the network, pcap, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files and summaries. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol.

More importantly, the Kalipso Node.js interface allows the analysts to see the profiles' behaviors and detections performed by Slips modules directly in the console. Kalipso displays the flows of each profile and time window and compares those connections in charts/bars. It also summarizes the whois/asn/geocountry information for each IP that communicates with a protected device.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Currently there is more than 2 Trillion USD market cap for the crypto currency market, DeFi alone is more than 100 Billion. With the popularity of the DeFi market, smart contracts again become the playground of hackers and security researchers. Token "robbery" became the most problematic issue for both investors and crypto currency exchange.

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is still the most widely used architect to support the core of smart contracts such as Polkadot, EVM and soon Cardano blockchain. Emulators built around EVM are merely good for development purposes. Most of the EVM analysis engines are just debugging tools based on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, these engines are just simple tools that do not encourage and support us to develop tools on top of them.

During Black Hat Asia, Arsenal 2021, we presented "Qiling: Smart Analysis for Smart Contract" [1] and explained the foundation of Qiling's EVM engine. In Blackhat USA Arsenal 2021, we would like to take this opportunity to demonstrate the full capabilities and tools that we build on top of the Qiling's EVM engine. That brings the complete traditional X86 reverse engineering experience to the smart contract space.

- Real time EVM debugger, with step into, step over and memory stack modification capabilities
- Full emulation of multi cross contract instrumentation
- Ultra fast emulation with pre-set environment variable
- Fully automated reapply and verify latest smart contract attack to all existing contract on a exchange or chain
- Make symbolic execution to work with Qiling EVM engine to provide a more in depth emulation
- Added a fully functional LLVM Intermediate Representation(IR). It allow a users to build a ultra fast fuzzer on-top of Qiling Framework.

To demonstrate the power of our framework and tools. We prepared some case study and demo on how we can rebuild the entire blockchain and verify the currently existing smart contract against the latest attack being discovered in the wild in the matters on few lines of code.

Once the talk ends, we will release the code and tools into the Qiling github repo, as usual.

For a long time before, a jailbroken IOS device is necessary for decrypting DRM protected app, which brings many problems for security researchers and malware analysts. And Apple's property DRM implementation and other components are highly protected with LLVM-based obfuscation, the lack of review and research may also leaves the vulnerability lasting. With the release of highly iOS-similar Apple Silicon device, we are able to explore more secrets of hardware and software on Apple platforms. My work will cover on three parts: firstly, how Fairplay DRM works and how to make a DRM decryption system on M1 Mac without breaking the system; secondly, possible attack surface of FairplayIOKit; and lastly, what methods Apple uses to obfuscate their property software and attack the weakness.

🔗 **Link:** [Tracee: Linux Runtime Security and Forensics Using eBPF](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee)  
📝 **Description:** Tracee is a runtime security and forensics tool for Linux. It is composed of tracee-ebpf, which collects OS events, and tracee-rules, which is the runtime security detection engine.


Tracee-ebpf is capable of tracing all processes in the system or a group of processes according to some given filters. The set of events to trace can be selected by the user and include the following:


1. System calls
2. LSM hooks (security_file_open, security_bprm_check, cap_capable, ...)
3. Internal kernel functions (vfs_write, commit_creds, ...)
4. Special events and alerts (magic_write, mem_prot_alert, ...)


Other than tracing, Tracee-ebpf is also capable of capturing files written to disk or memory (e.g. "fileless" malwares), and extracting binaries that are dynamically loaded to an application's memory (e.g. when a malware uses a packer). Using these capabilities, it is possible to automatically collect forensic artifacts for later investigation.
Tracee-Rules, is a rule engine that helps you detect suspicious behavioral patterns in streams of events. It is primarily made to leverage events collected with Tracee-eBPF into a Runtime Security solution.
Tracee supports authoring rules in Golang or in Rego.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Joern is an award-winning open-source platform for robust query-based analysis of C/C++. It enables mining large code bases for vulnerabilities using a Scala-based domain-specific query language and provides the reference implementation for code property graphs. With its fuzzy parsing approach, it is specifically suited for machine learning applications. Joern serves as the fundament for the commercial SAST and code exploration products at ShiftLeft.

The Code Property Graph (CPG) is an intermediate code representation designed for code querying. The core idea it promotes is to merge multiple different program representations into a joint graph data structure and allowing queries to be formulated as graph traversals. In its initial form as presented in 2014, the CPG makes available syntactical information, control flow information and data flow for C/C++ programs. It was later further generalized to host multiple different programming languages, and higher-level code representations.

<details><summary><strong>Find Security Bugs</strong></summary>

![Category: 🌐 Web/AppSec or Red Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🌐%20Web/AppSec%20or%20Red%20Teaming-blue) ![Philippe Arteau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Philippe%20Arteau-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Find Security Bugs](https://github.com/find-sec-bugs/find-sec-bugs)  
📝 **Description:** Find Security Bugs is a plugin for the Java static analysis tool SpotBugs. This plugin consists of set rules that focus only on security weaknesses. It can be used by developers or security professionals to find vulnerabilities in their code.

The plugin can identify weaknesses in Java web applications from 138 different bug patterns including XSS, SQL injection, XXE, template injection and many more. It can scan any JVM languages such as Kotlin, Scala and Groovy. The assessment can be done in an IDE, such as Eclipse, or IntelliJ. It can also be configured in a continuous integration environment.

The most recent additions to the project include features to the IDE integration and Continuous Integration (CI). The IDE IntelliJ integration was greatly improved to have better support for alternative languages such as Kotlin. This makes it easier to scan Android applications. IDE integration is a great perspective for code audit. For developers, continuous integration is a highly sought-after configuration. A new Github Action will be presented. It provides an easy feedback for developers when integrating code to the master branch with a pull request.

The Black Hat Arsenal's demonstrations will include a live code review where samples of vulnerability and practical methods will be showcased in the new IDE and CI environment.

🔗 **Link:** [New Face, Who Dis? Protecting Privacy in a World of Surveillance](https://gist.github.com/summerofgeorge/7b996d51e0d79286c3d14040d51d69ce)  
📝 **Description:** While it has its potential benefits, facial recognition is eroding privacy and other human rights. Over the past year, several organizations have acknowledged that they have "scraped" social media and similar sites for photos to build their biometric databases, and photos intended for personal use only have now been potentially weaponized.

Industry and government have ethical responsibilities to prevent this, but what if there were a way to enhance privacy for individuals without waiting for the cavalry? Adversarial technology can provide a way to protect this biometric, but it must be as easy to use as picking up their mobile device and taking a photo.

Introducing "Ruse," a mobile app that seeks to use adversarial strategies to make personal photos less useful for commercial facial recognition systems while retaining a (relatively) low impact on human usefulness.

<details><summary><strong>reNgine: An Automated Reconnaissance Framework</strong></summary>

![Category: 🌐 Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🌐%20Web/AppSec-blue) ![Yogesh Ojha](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yogesh%20Ojha-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [reNgine: An Automated Reconnaissance Framework](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine)  
📝 **Description:** reNgine is an automated reconnaissance engine(framework) that is capable of performing end-to-end reconnaissance with the help of highly configurable scan engines on web application targets. reNgine makes use of various open-source tools and makes a highly configurable pipeline of reconnaissance to gather the recon result.

reNgine also makes it possible for users to choose the tools they desire while following the same reconnaissance pipeline, example - with reNgine you aren't limited to using sublist3r for subdomains discovery, rather reNgine allows you to combine multiple tools like sublist3r, subfinder, assetfinder, and easily integrate them into your reconnaissance pipeline. The reconnaissance results are then displayed in a beautiful and structured UI after performing the co-relation in the results produced by these various tools. The developers behind reNgine understand that recon result most often is overwhelming due to the humongous data, so that's why reNgine also comes with advanced query lookup using natural language operators like and, or and not. Imagine, doing recon on facebook.com and filtering the results like

http_status!404&page_title=admin|page_title=dashboard&content_length>0&tech=php

or

severity=critical|severity=high&vulnerability_title=xss|vulerability_title=cve-1234-xxxx

reNgine's flexibility to easily incorporate any existing open-source tools and with advanced features like configurable scan engines, parallel scans, advanced query lookup on recon results, instant notification about the scan, scheduled scans, etc, separates reNgine from any other recon frameworks.

reNgine can be used for both reconnaissance and actively monitoring the targets.

During the Arsenal, the developers behind reNgine will demonstrate the capabilities and new features announcements.

What has changed since BHEU 2019?
1. Integration of Vulnerability Scanner
2. More powerful query lookup with recon data
3. OSINT Capabilities (Major update)
4. Scan Comparision - ability to identify the changes in subdomains, newly discovered subdomains or subdomains that disappeared in last scan etc
5. Interesting Lookup: reNgine will automatically identify the interesting subdomains and interesting URLs from recon data using the keywords match.
And many more..
