  "Description": "Have you ever found a novel vulnerability in a website, framework, javascript library, or third-party integration, and wondered how many other people in the world are vulnerable, too? Have you ever wished that you could non-invasively grep the internet for a vulnerability indicator?\n\nWARCannon was built for exactly this purpose, and is fed by Common Crawl via the AWS Open Data program to allow for petabyte-scale analysis of previously-spidered websites. Security researchers and bug bounty hunters can leverage WARCannon to scale their research horizontally across the entire internet in a fast, cost-effective, and entirely non-invasive/invisible way.",
