  "Description": "PyRDP is a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) monster-in-the-middle (MITM) tool and library useful in intrusion testing and malware research. Its out of the box offensive capabilities can be divided in three broad categories: client-side, MITM-side and server-side. On the client-side PyRDP can actively steal any clipboard activity, crawl mapped drives and collect all keystrokes. On the MITM-side PyRDP records everything on the wire in several formats (logs, JSON events), allows the attacker to take control of an active session and performs a pixel perfect recording of the RDP screen. On the server-side, on-logon PowerShell or cmd injection can be performed when a legitimate client connects.\n\nOn the malware research side, PyRDP can be used as part of a fully interactive honeypot. It can be placed in front of a Windows RDP server to intercept malicious sessions. It can replace the credentials provided in the connection sequence with working credentials to accelerate compromise and malicious behavior collection. It also saves a visual and textual recording of each RDP session, which is useful for investigation or to generate IOCs. Additionally, PyRDP saves a copy of the files that are transferred via the drive redirection feature, allowing it to collect malicious payloads.\n\nOver the last year, we implemented several features that we are going to uncover in this brand-new arsenal workshop: improved file interception and crawling, dynamic certificate cloning, CredSSP/NLA support with private certificate and key, dynamic NLA redirection, NTLMSSP hash logging, and more.",
