  "Description": "Ipa-medit is a memory search and patch tool for resigned ipa without jailbreaking. It was created for mobile game security testing.\n\nMemory modification is the easiest way to cheat in games, it is one of the items to be checked in the security test. There are also cheat tools that can be used casually like GameGem and iGameGuardian on iOS. However, there were no tools available for un-jailbroken device. So I made it as a security testing tool.\n\nThere is an android version of the tool, apk-medit(https://github.com/aktsk/apk-medit), that I created.\n\nMany mobile games have jailbreak detection, but ipa-medit does not require jailbreaking, so memory modification can be done without bypassing the jailbreak detection.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/aktsk/ipa-medit",
