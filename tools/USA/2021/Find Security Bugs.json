  "Description": "Find Security Bugs is a plugin for the Java static analysis tool SpotBugs. This plugin consists of set rules that focus only on security weaknesses. It can be used by developers or security professionals to find vulnerabilities in their code.\n\nThe plugin can identify weaknesses in Java web applications from 138 different bug patterns including XSS, SQL injection, XXE, template injection and many more. It can scan any JVM languages such as Kotlin, Scala and Groovy. The assessment can be done in an IDE, such as Eclipse, or IntelliJ. It can also be configured in a continuous integration environment.\n\nThe most recent additions to the project include features to the IDE integration and Continuous Integration (CI). The IDE IntelliJ integration was greatly improved to have better support for alternative languages such as Kotlin. This makes it easier to scan Android applications. IDE integration is a great perspective for code audit. For developers, continuous integration is a highly sought-after configuration. A new Github Action will be presented. It provides an easy feedback for developers when integrating code to the master branch with a pull request.\n\nThe Black Hat Arsenal's demonstrations will include a live code review where samples of vulnerability and practical methods will be showcased in the new IDE and CI environment.",
