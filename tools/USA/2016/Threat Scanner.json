  "Description": "Threatscanner is an endpoint IOC scanner. It consumes OpenIOC and Yara rules and scans Windows machines, matching the rules. It produces a report for any matches detailing all the information about the matched items. In addition, it details the logic path used to arrive at the match - showing which predicates in the rule matched and which were missed. The system has many performance optimizations; such as aggregating rules so each potential item is only evaluated once regardless of the number of rules tested. This means that the running time for a single rule roughly matches the running time for 1000s of rules.",
