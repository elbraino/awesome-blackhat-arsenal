  "Description": "Vulnreport is designed to accelerate management of penetration tests and security code reviews/audits, as well as generation of useful vulnerability reports. Using Vulnreport, security researchers can automate almost all of the overhead involved with penetration testing so that they can devote more time to the fun stuff - finding vulns. Vulnreport takes care of tracking vulnerabilities on your tests, providing a simple UI for managing them, and running analytics on what you're finding and where you're spending your time.Vulnreport is also a platform that can be extended and hooked into whatever other management and vulnerability assessment tools are part of your process. Hook it up to your automated testing frameworks and watch the vuln data flow into your reports like magic.This demo will walk through the upsides of automating this part of your pentesting process as well as show how the Salesforce Product Security team uses Vulnreport to save hundreds of engineer-hours per year. We will be open-sourcing and making the tool available for you and your teams to use, customize, and contribute to during the conference.",
