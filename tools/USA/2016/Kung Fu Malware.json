  "Description": "Focusing on Windows operating systems, we've developed an agent to try to activate some techniques that malware usually include to avoid being detected by a sandbox or malware analyst, emulating malware analysis computer inside a common PC. This agent would add a new layer of protection without interacting with the malware, because current malware will not run their malicious payload in a sandbox or while being debbuged. As we know the different malware families implement anti-reversing, anti-debuging and anti-virtualization characteristics along with other techniques such as to detect well known process and windows. Malware writers implement these techniques to prevent the execution of malicious code within a laboratory that could help researchers in their analysis and eradication.Some of those are:Detecting when a program is being debugged.Detecting when a program is running in a virtual machine, by reading some registry keys or locating some files or processes used by the virtualization technology.The detection programs used by malware analysts such as wireshark, IDA or process explorer.The proliferation of those techniques and strategies has brought us to a new solution; pretend the behavior of a malware analysis device and / or sandbox, by using some of the techniques explained above, in order to prevent the execution of the malicious code.",
