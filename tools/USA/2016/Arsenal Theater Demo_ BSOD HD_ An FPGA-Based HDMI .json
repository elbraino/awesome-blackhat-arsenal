  "Description": "BSODomizer HD is an open source, FPGA-based, covert electronic device that injects and captures HDMI signals. Currently a proof-of-concept design, this much anticipated follow-up to the original BSODomizer released in 2008 (www.bsodomizer.com) improves on the graphics interception and triggering features, and can capture screenshots of any non-HDCP target up to 1080p resolution. Uses of the tool include penetration testing, video display calibration, mischievous acts, or as a reference design for exploration into the mystical world of FPGAs.Co-developed by Joe Grand (aka Kingpin) of Grand Idea Studio and Zoz of Cannytrophic Design.",
