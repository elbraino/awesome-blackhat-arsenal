  "Description": "CodexGigas is a malware profiling search engine that allows malware hunters and analysts to really interrogate the internals of malware and perform searches over a large number of file characteristics. For instance, instead of relying on file-level hashes, we can compute other features such as imported functions, strings, constants, file segments, code regions, or anything that is defined in the file type specification, and that provides us with more than 142 possible searchable patterns, that can be combined.Similar to human fingerprints, every malware has its own unique digital fingerprint that differentiates it from others. As a result, malware will always attempt to hide its true self by deleting or changing this information to avoid detection by antivirus companies and malware researchers.Since malware developers go to great lengths to obfuscate their characteristics, it is often difficult for by researchers and malware analysts to identify multiple characteristics and correlation points. By analyzing malware internals, the algorithm is able to build characteristic families to which a new sample can be categorized and therefore identified for specific behavior, enabling early detection of new malware by comparing against existing malware. CodexGigas engine, framework, analysis plugins, and the web portal, will be released as open source at Black Hat.Come to see how CodexGigas could be used to enhance your malware hunting.
