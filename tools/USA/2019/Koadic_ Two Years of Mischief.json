  "Description": "Koadic is a post-exploitation toolkit that leverages the Windows Script Host, delivering all the features expected from a modern RAT via VBScript/JScript. Koadic was first released at DEF CON in 2017, and has since seen two years of development. Koadic is robust enough to have been chosen in nation-state cyberespionage campaigns by APT favorites such as Fancy Bear, Stone Panda, and MuddyWater. It has been the tool of choice on the road to domain admin for many pentests, especially in environments where PowerShell and filesystems are heavily audited by antivirus.\n\nNew payloads have been added since release, such as Squiblytwo WMIC.exe XSL files (discovered by SubTee and Mattifestation) and Bitsadmin.exe transfer jobs. Existing payloads have been upgraded to include obfuscation and antivirus evasion.\n\nSeveral new implants have been added, including UAC bypasses via slui, fodhelper, compmgmtlauncher, and compdefaults. A loot finder module automates the process of finding files which may contain sensitive data. Persistence is now available via registry autoruns, WMI, and scheduled tasks. \"One shot\" stagers now allow an implant to be run immediately on a zombies first call home.\n\nA new credential storage feature has been added, transforming Mimikatz outputs acquired into a readily searchable format. A full fledged API is also available, allowing all available functionality of the toolkit to be automated through HTTP interactions. There are innumerable bug fixes, improvements to reliability, and additional stealth since the initial release, with new features being added regularly.",
