  "Description": "Various approaches have been developed through the years for malware analysis and vary from static, dynamic, behavioral, network, memory, and automated. Each analyst has developed his/her own strategy when analyzing malware. However, the accuracy of the results relies densely on their knowledge of system internals, analytical skills, and even reverse engineering. Therefore, novice analysts generate a strict dependency on experienced people to ensure the proper delivery of threat reports.\n\nEven experienced analysts and reverse engineers could miss critical details, such as unexplored code paths, a specific or new self-defense mechanism, a challenging obfuscation algorithm difficult to decipher quickly, or hidden data that was not revealed in early stages. All of this is due to time constraints or a potential lack of information tracking throughout the analysis process.\n\nBLACKPHENIX performs an Intelligent Automation and Analysis by combining all the known malware analysis approaches, automating the time-consuming stages and counter-attacking malware behavioral patterns. The objective: generate precise IOCs by revealing the real malware purpose and exposing its hidden data and related functionalities that are used to exfiltrate or compromise the user's information.\n\nThis framework focuses on consolidating, correlating, and cross-referencing the data collected between analysis stages by the execution of Python scripts and helper modules, providing full synchronization between the debugger, disassembler, and supporting components. The automation modules allow interaction with external tools and libraries that can be used to scale the framework functionality by developing plug-ins on top of it, allowing people of any skill level adapt it to their needs and producing actionable threat information in the shape of technical threat reports, IPS/AV signatures or the discovery of new malware attacks, variants or families.\n\nThe presentation will include a live demo of the system processing real different categories of malware taken from the wild.",
