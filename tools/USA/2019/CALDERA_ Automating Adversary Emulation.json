  "Description": "Adversary emulation is great, but it can be time consuming \u2013 so why not automate it? CALDERA automates the adversary emulation process, allowing users to run fully automated adversary emulation exercises, aligning its operations with MITRE ATT&CK. Blue and red teamers alike can use CALDERA for training, to test analytics and defensive tools, and just generally to stress test their networks and systems.\n\n\nCALDERA was first released in late 2017 featuring its end-to-end \u201cadversary mode\u201d capability, where operators could use CALDERA to run fully end-to-end tests emulating the full adversary lifecycle. This mode allowed CALDERA to run intelligently and autonomously, leveraging a planning system to dynamically compose operations.\n\n\nSince this first release, the MITRE team has continued to expand CALDERA\u2019s capabilities, releasing a new \u201cchain mode\u201d in 2019. This new mode allows users much more control over CALDERA, letting them orchestrate and automate atomic unit tests as opposed to end-to-end operations. With more fine-grained control over CALDERA, users can better control their operations to accommodate more use cases, such as testing and refining analytics.\n\n\nThis demo will highlight both of CALDERA\u2019s modes, providing demos and guides on how to use CALDERA including how to extend it with new plugins and adding additional tests. CALDERA is open source and can be downloaded off of the MITRE GitHub repository.",
