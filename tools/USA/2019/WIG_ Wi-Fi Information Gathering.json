  "Description": "WIG (Wi-Fi Information Gathering) is a free and open source (GPLv3) utility for IEEE 802.11 device fingerprinting. WIG uses Wi-Fi network interfaces that supports monitor mode to obtain information on nearby devices with Wi-Fi support. The tool supports vendors proprietary protocols such as Apple AirDrop/AirPlay, Cisco Client eXtensions, Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and Wi-Fi Direct. Using these protocols the tool is able to find and fingerprint potential Wi-Fi targets that other tools are not able to find. The tool output it's useful on the threat modeling phase during wi-fi penetration testing or to find potential targets during a network assessment.",
