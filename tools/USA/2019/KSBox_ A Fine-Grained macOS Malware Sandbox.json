  "Description": "Last year I published the Kemon open source project, which included a Pre and Post callback-based kernel inline hook engine. By using this engine, we can easily implement IPC and XPC monitoring, which helps build a fine-grained macOS malware sandbox. Therefore, there will be a new useful tool in our arsenal in August: KSBox.\n\nCurrently, KSBox malware sandbox has the following features: process and file operation monitoring; macOS IPC, XPC and network traffic monitoring; dynamic library and kernel extension monitoring; Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy monitoring and filtering, etc. In short, security analysts can use this project to better analyze and gain insight into macOS malware.",
