  "Description": "AttackForge.com is a free-to-use collaboration platform to manage pentesting projects. AttackForge allows a project team to easily collaborate in one place, reducing overheads and pain for Business, Technology and Pentest Team. This is what makes AttackForge unique and different to other pentest collaboration solutions. It goes beyond automated reporting and issue library. It's like JIRA for pentesting.\n\nPentesters love to break things. However they hate responding to unnecessary emails and phone calls; having to chase people for details to start testing; having to figure out who to talk to when things aren't working; and most of all having to write and review reports. AttackForge.com is purpose built to help pentesters focus their time and efforts on breaking things, and reduce distractions and unnecessary tasks. This helps to get the best out of the pentest team and provide better results for business.\n\nAttackForge.com also helps people to start a career in penetration testing. AttackForge provides a secure online environment to create a portfolio of pentests to reflect skills, knowledge and communication ability in an industry-standard way \u2013 to demonstrate to recruiters and prospective employers that they are ready for the workforce. This may in turn help to reduce the shortage of supply and skills-gap our industry is currently facing.",
