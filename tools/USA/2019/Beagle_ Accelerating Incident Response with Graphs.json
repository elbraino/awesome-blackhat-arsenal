  "Description": "Beagle is a tool which aims to accelerate an analyst's ability to respond to incidents by allowing them to quickly and reliably generate incident response oriented graphs from a variety of data sources.\n\nBeagle takes, as input, a wide variety of types of data:\n\nHost based logs such as FireEye HX, Sysmon or security event logs.\nFull memory images (using volatility).\nSandbox reports such as Cuckoo.\nStreamed data from your SIEM.\n\nBeagle also supports inserting alert nodes into your graphs. For example, FireEye HX triages will contain an alert, and the process which it has alerted on. Beagle will automatically insert an alert node, and create the edge between the alert node and what it alerted on.\n\nIn Beagle's web interface, analysts can select the data they uploaded and quickly work through the incident. If an alert node is present, the graph will automatically focus on the context around that node based on what the alert node has an edge to, allowing analysts to extremely quickly pivot through an incident. Analysts can pivot between nodes using simple clicks, as well as remove and search for nodes. Additionally, the graphs can be transformed into rooted trees, or seen as timelines (based on what is currently visible in the graph).\n\nBeagle is also easily extended. Do you have a unique data source not yet supported? Implement 7 functions and Beagle will support it. Graph algorithms can also be implemented using networkx, and can be automatically run when a graph is viewed in the browser, allowing you to even further speed up your incident response time.\n\nBeagle: https://github.com/yampelo/beagle",
