  "Description": "Kubernetes is today's most popular container orchestrator. But it's also a complex distributed system, with defaults tuned for usability rather than for security. More so, configuring Kubernetes correctly is not trivial. Failing to configure Kubernetes in a secure way exposes the applications running on it to imminent risk, regardless of how securely those application are built.\n\nWe recognized the need to assess the level of security of a Kubernetes cluster deployment, and built kube-hunter to be an extensible pentesting and risk assessment platform for Kubernetes environments. We contributed quite a few discovery and hunt techniques from the get-go, and will add more over time. Kube-hunter is also designed to be easily extended by the community. This is the current list of tests:\nPassive Tests (tests not making any change to the cluster):\n\nGenerates ip addresses to scan, based on cluster/scan type\nScans known Kubernetes ports to determine open endpoints for discovery\nChecks for an open API Server\nChecks for open Kubelet ports\nChecks for an open Proxy service\nChecks for email addresses in kubernetes ssl certificates\nHunts for a dashboard behind the proxy\nHunts open Dashboards, gets the type of nodes in the cluster\nReads specific endpoints on open ports in the readonly Kubelet server\nHunting Azure cluster deployments using specific known configurations\nHunting etcd, checks for remote availability of etcd, its version, and read access to the DB\nHunting API server using the service account token obtained from a compromised pod\nVulnerabilities hunter:\n\u25cb CVE-2018-1002105\n\u25cb CVE-2019-1002100\n\nActive Tests (may perform state-changing actions on the cluster):\n\nRetrieves logs from a random container\nHunts Proxy when exposed, extracts the version\nHunts when proxy is exposed, extracts the build date of kubernetes\nExecutes uname inside of a random container\nGets the Azure subscription file on the host by executing inside a container\nHunting etcd, checks for remote write access to etcd- will attempt to add a new key to the etcd DB\nAccessing the api server might grant an attacker full control over the cluster",
