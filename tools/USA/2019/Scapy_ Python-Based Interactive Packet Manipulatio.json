  "Description": "Scapy (https://github.com/secdev/scapy) is a renowned packet manipulation tool written in Python that supports a wide number of protocols on many different platforms (Linux, macOS, *BSD, and Windows). Initially developed by Philippe Biondi since 2003, it is now maintained by Guillaume Valadon, Pierre Lalet and Gabriel Potter. While the existence of this tool is well-known, its grip is much less, to the community's detriment. This presentation aims at filling this gap using practical and detailed examples.",
