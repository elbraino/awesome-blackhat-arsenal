  "Description": "\"MalConfScan with Cuckoo\" is a tool for automatically extracting known malware configuration data. With the growing number of malware variants emerging day by day, the automation of malware analysis using sandbox systems is becoming popular. Such systems have a function to list malware behavior on Windows OS, such as communication, file and registry creation. On the other hand, malware analysts spend more time extracting malware configuration data rather than analyzing malware behavior. There are two reasons for it:\n\n1. Many malware variants mostly share the same code except for configuration data. In other words, a type of malware and configuration data are the only elements that need to be checked.\n\n2. Malware configuration data contains an attack campaign ID and communication encryption keys. This information would be the critical data for investigating logs in incident response, and also for knowing the actor's target.\n\nWe present a malware analysis tool to extract configuration data for incident responders and malware analysts. This tool automates analysis for many types of malware based on our long-time research and, reduce the time spent on malware analysis. In addition, this tool can be used not only for malware analysis but also for memory forensics. It can help a victim organization with malware infection to identify C2 server information and encryption key which are necessary for their incident response.",
