  "Description": "Lauschger\u00e4t gets in the way of your victim and out of yours. This python tool acts as a convenient man-in-the-middle tool to sniff traffic, terminate TLS encryption, host malicious services and bypass 802.1X - provided you have physical access to the victim machine, or at least its network cable.\n\nThere are three ways to run it: Either on its own dedicated device like a Raspberry Pi or Banana Pi, in a virtual machine with two physical USB-NICs attached, or on your regular pentest system in its own network namespace. It will look like a completely transparent piece of wire to both victim systems you are getting in the middle of, even if they are using 802.1X because it is implementing the ideas presented in a talk by Alva Lease 'Skip' Duckwall IV.\n\nThe Lauschger\u00e4t operates with three interfaces: Two interfaces going to the victim client and the victim switch respectively, and one management interface which you can connect to and initiate the redirection of traffic, inject your own traffic, start and stop malicious services, and so forth. It comes with a few services included, such as a service that terminates TLS encryption (which will of course cause a certificate warning on the victim's end) or a service that performs the classic \"SSL strip\" attack. And more to come!\n\nAn optional wireless interfaces can either be used as another management interface or for intercepting traffic of wireless devices. The management can be done via SSH or via a web application, making sure you can hit the ground running.",
