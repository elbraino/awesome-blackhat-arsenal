  "Description": "Threat intelligence chat bots are useful friends. They perform research for you and can even be note takers or central aggregators of information. However, it seems like most organizations want to design their own bot in isolation and keep it internal. To counter this trend, our goal was to create a repeatable process using a completely free open source framework, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi (or even virtual machine), and host a community-driven plugin framework to open up the world of threat intel chat bots to everyone from the average home user to the largest security operations center.\n\nWe were thrilled to debut the end result of our research (a chat bot that we affectionately call CyBot) at Black Hat Arsenal Vegas 2017. To build on that momentum we also brought CyBot to Black Hat Europe and Asia to gather more great feedback and ideas from an enthusiastic international crowd. This year's Black Hat Vegas will allow us to share new features that stemmed from Black Hat feedback as well as enhancements provided by a platform upgrade.\n\nBest of all, if you know even a little bit of Python, you can help our global collaboration efforts by writing plugins and sharing them with the community. If you want to build your own CyBot, the instructions in this project will let you do so with about an hour of invested time and anywhere from $0-$35 in expenses. Come make your own threat intelligence chat bot today!",
