  "Description": "There are billions of containers started by organizations on a daily basis. Thus, there has been a considerable need to invest in container security along with the security for conventional compute instance (like a physical machine, AWS EC2, etc.). Currently, there is no open-source automated solution that enables the organization to constantly monitor security hygiene of their container ecosystem.\n\nArmourBird CSF - Container Security Framework is an extensible, modular, API-first framework build for regular security monitoring of docker installations and containers against CIS and other custom security checks.\n\nArmourBird CSF has a client-server architecture and is thus divided into two components:\n\na) CSF Client\n\nThis component is responsible for monitoring the docker installations, containers, and images on target machines\nIn the initial release, it will be checking against Docker CIS benchmark\nThe checks in the CSF client will be configurable and thus will be expanded in future releases and updates\nIt has been build on top of Docker bench for security\n\nb) CSF Server\n\nThis will be the receiver agent for the security logs generated by the various distributed CSF clients (installed on multiple physical/virtual machines)\nThis will also have a UI sub-component for unified management and dashboard-ing of the various vulnerabilities/issues logged by the CSF Clients\nThis server will also expose APIs that can be used for integrating with other systems\n\nWatch out this GitHub space for update: https://github.com/armourbird\nFollow the tool updates on twitter: https://twitter.com/ArmourBird",
