  "Description": "Sysmon is a free and powerful host-level tracing tool, developed by an epic team at Microsoft, which has been widely adopted and deployed by defenders over the last few years. The tool provides a free alternative for those who want to augment the Microsoft Windows Auditing Capabilities, effectively enabling them to detect anomalous endpoint behaviors and to perform threat-hunting activities over the collected data.\n\nDespite providing a lot of features, Sysmon main disadvantage is around its closed-source nature. Not having the ability to extend the tool data collection or to extend the way that the tool filters, aggregate and logically correlate events are impacting on the tool's ability to keep up with the current threat landscape. What is more, the infosec community is not empowered to fix the well-known subversion and evasion techniques created to bypass tool auditing (i.e Matt Graeber talk at BH USA 18).\n\nIntroducing SysmonX: SysmonX is an open-source, community-driven, and drop-in replacement version of Sysmon that provides a modularized architecture with the purpose of enabling the infosec community to:\n\nExtend the Sysmon data collection sources and create new security events\nExtend the Sysmon ability to correlate events. Effectively enabling new logical operations between events and the creation of advanced detection capabilities\nEnrich the current set of events with more data!\nEnable the false positive reduction by narrowing down suspicious events through dedicated scanners\nExtend the security configuration schema\nReact to known subversion and evasion techniques that impact Sysmon, and by doing so, increasing the resilience of security auditing and data collection mechanism such as this one.\n\nSysmonX is composed of a standalone binary that gets itself deployed as a windows service, supports legacy Sysmon configurations and event reporting mechanism, while also providing users the ability to configure all the SysmonX aspects through command-line interface. The SysmonX binary is a drop-in replacement of Sysmon. This effectively means that SysmonX is a feature-compatible version of Sysmon (same input, same output). This is possible thanks to the SysmonX ability to package, deploy, manage Sysmon binaries behind the scene. SysmonX uses this to intercept data collected by Sysmon drivers, enrich them, along with the ability to create, combine, and add scanning logic on top of new security events. The result is a combined output, with the old good features from Sysmon + the new features from SysmonX.\n\nExample of new security events and features added to SysmonX are:\n\nCmdline and Parent Process Spoofing detection\nWMI calls over all the namespaces, not just root:subscription\nAbility to collect authentication information\nAbility to collect powershell events\nAbility to collect DNS lookups\nAbility to detect userspace injection techniques (eventing + memory inspection through built in scanner modules)\nAbility to perform regex over security event fields\nMany more!\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/marcosd4h/sysmonx",
