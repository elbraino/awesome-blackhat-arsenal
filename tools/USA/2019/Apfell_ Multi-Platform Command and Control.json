  "Description": "Apfell is a collaborative, command and control platform designed to facilitate a plug-n-play architecture. It uses a web-based front-end so that it can be accessed from any OS and a Python/Docker based back-end. Apfell focuses on quality of life improvements for operators, especially while operating across macOS and *nix operating systems, such as searchable tasks, per-task comments, artifact tracking, MITRE ATT&CK mappings/exports, multiple concurrent c2 profiles, command versioning, and much more. It features a JavaScript for Automation (JXA) agent that runs in memory on macOS devices, but offers agents across a variety of platforms and services.",
