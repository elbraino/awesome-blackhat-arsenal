  "Description": "AADInternals is a PowerShell module for administering Azure AD and Office 365. It is a result of hours of reverse-engineering and debugging of Microsoft tools related to Azure AD, such as PowerShell modules, directory synchronisation, and admin portals.\n\nAADInternals contains tools for retrieving detailed information about Azure AD/Office 365 tenant not available otherwise, tools for manipulating Azure AD objects (e.g., users and passwords), and tools for creating backdoors to Azure AD/Office 365. The backdoor tools are based on the discovery and research of a vulnerability in Azure AD identity federation.",
