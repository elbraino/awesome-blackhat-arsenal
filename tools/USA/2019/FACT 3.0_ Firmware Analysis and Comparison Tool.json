  "Description": "The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) is intended to automate firmware security analysis. Thereby, it shall be easy to use (web GUI), extend (plug-in system) and integrate (REST API). When analyzing Firmware, you face several challenges: unpacking, initial analysis, identifying changes towards other versions, find other firmware images that might share vulnerabilities you just found. FACT is able to automate many aspects of these challenges leading to a massive speed-up in the firmware analysis process. This means you can focus on the fun part of finding new vulnerabilities, whereas FACT does all the boring stuff for you.",
