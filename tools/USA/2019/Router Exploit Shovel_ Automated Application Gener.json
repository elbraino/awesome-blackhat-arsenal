The tool implements the key functions of exploits, it can adapt to the length of the data padding on the stack, generate the ROP chain, generate the encoded shellcode, and finally assemble them into a complete attack code. The user only needs to attach the attack code to the overflow location of the POC to complete the Exploit of the remote code execution. The tool also incorporates live recovery, leaving no trace of attack after the Exploit attack is completed.",
