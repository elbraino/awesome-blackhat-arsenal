  "Description": "Patronus is a fully dockerised and comprehensive config driven Security Framework which helps to detect security vulnerabilities in the Software Development Life Cycle of any application. The framework inculcates a highly automated approach for vulnerability identification and management. With Patronus's fully whitebox approach, the framework currently covers four major verticals; Secrets Scanning, Software Composition Analysis, Static Application Security Testing and Asset Inventory. Finding all these four verticals together is a very strenuous task in the industry as no other framework currently solves this like Patronus which provides a fully comprehensive dashboard containing all the four verticals in a single central platform, and this is something very unique to Patronus. Patronus automatically identifies the latest code commits and focuses on the major aspects of the application source code to identify and detect key and high severity vulnerabilities within the application and aims for minimal false positives in the reports.\n\nThe framework focuses on the needs of the security engineers and the developers alike with a dedicated web dashboard to abstract all the nitty gritty technicalities of the security vulnerabilities detected and also empowers the user with higher level of vulnerability tracking for better patch management. The dashboard is built completely with analytics, functionality and maintaining ease in mind to demonstrate and display various metrics for the scans and vulnerabilities. It also helps to search, analyze and resolve vulnerabilities on-the-go and provides a completely consolidated vulnerability report.\n\nPatronus is very powerful and hugely reduces the time and efforts of the security team in thoroughly reviewing any application from a security lens. The framework comes with an on-demand scanning feature apart from the scheduled daily automated scans, using which developers and security engineers can scan particular branches and repositories at any point of time in the SDLC, directly from the dashboard or integrations like Slack. The framework is completely adaptable and various software like Slack and Jira can be easily integrated directly with Patronus for better accessibility and tracking since most organizations today use these extensively.",
