  "Description": "FireTail sits on top of popular open source frameworks for building web services and APIs, like OpenAPI/Swagger, Express and Rails, and then provides in-line security processing of the API calls. FireTail checks for (in sequential order):\n1. API call is hitting valid route using a valid method. This allows for a zero-trust, declarative API structure, with proper error handling at the HTTP layer.\n2. Inspection of authentication token. Does the API expect a JWT, application-issued API key or other? FireTail will check whether a valid token of the correct type is present.\n3. Payload inspection. FireTail will look for and fail invalid queries.",
