  "Description": "Siembol is an in-house developed security data processing application, forming the core of an internal Security Data Platform.\n\nFollowing the experience of using Splunk, and as early adopters of Apache Metron, the team needed a highly efficient, real-time event processing engine with fewer limitations and more enhanced features. With Metron now retired, Siembol hopes to give the community an evolved alternative.\n\nSiembol improvements over Metron:\n- Components for real-time alert escalation: CSIRT teams can easily create a rule-based alert from a single data source, or they can create advanced correlation rules that combine various data sources. Moreover, Siembol UI supports importing a Sigma rule into Siembol alerting.\n- Ability to integrate with other systems using dedicated components and plugin architecture for easy integration with incident response tools\n- Advanced parsing framework for building fault-tolerant parsers\n- Enhanced enrichment component allowing for defining rules and joining enrichment tables\n- Configurations and rules are defined by a modern Angular web application, with a git-based approval process\n- Supports OAuth2/OIDC for authentication and authorization in Siembol UI\n- Easy installation for use with prepared docker images, helm charts and quick start guide\n\nSiembol Use Cases:\n- SIEM log collection using open-source technologies\n- Detection tool for discovery of leaks and attacks on infrastructure\n- Real-time stream Sigma rule evaluation without the need to index logs",
