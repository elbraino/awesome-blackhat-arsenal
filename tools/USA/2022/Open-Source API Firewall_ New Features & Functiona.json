  "Description": "The open-source API Firewall by Wallarm is a great option for API development. It offers a rich feature set, and its underlying technology is mature. The firewall's new feature of blocklisting for compromised tokens and cookies is a great way to gain visibility into threats and prevent issues. The feature is easy to set up and offers a high degree of visibility into the security posture of your APIs and services.",
