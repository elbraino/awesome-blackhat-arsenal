  "Description": "Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are one of the defining tradecraft for identifying an Advanced Persistent Threat. The reason being is that APTs typically leverage custom toolkits for gaining initial access, so they do not risk burning full-featured implants. Badrats takes characteristics from APT Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and implements them into a custom Command and Control (C2) tool with a focus on initial access and implant flexibility. The key goal is to emulate that modern threat actors avoid loading fully-featured implants unless required, instead opting to use a smaller staged implant.\n\nBadrats implants are written in various languages, each with a similar yet limited feature set. The implants are designed to be small for antivirus evasion and provides multiple methods of loading additional tools, such as shellcode, .NET assemblies, PowerShell, and shell commands on a compromised host. One of the most advanced TTPs that Badrats supports is peer-to-peer communications over SMB to allow implants to communicate through other compromised hosts.",
