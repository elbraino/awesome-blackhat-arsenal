  "Description": "Have you ever had to Google around trying to find a default password for a router? Are you sick of combing through user manuals just to find admin:admin buried on page 37. Then it's time you tried Defaultinator. This newly released tool is a repository for default credentials made searchable via API or the intuitive web interface. Why would someone make such a tool? Why, I'm so glad you asked!\n\nStatic device passwords are not only Really Bad, they are sometimes illegal. Yet legacy or poorly secured IoT devices still often contain default or hardcoded passwords. It's hard to know if you have default passwords in your environment, but this tool is here to help you find them. Or maybe you are on a Red Team engagement and want to audit for CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). Defaultinator has your back.\n\nIn this talk, I'll cover how default passwords contribute to the spread of malware, how common it is to see them used in brute force attacks 'in the wild', and how a tool like Defaultinator can help you identify them and remove them from your own environment.",
