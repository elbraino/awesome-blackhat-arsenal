  "Description": "When it comes to generating and delivering malware on Linux, offensive operators have choices. Some objectives call for a dynamic payload bootstrap off the wire, others require stageless implants.\n\nOften, malware deployed with bundled payloads can be successfully detected and analyzed. However, we think there are opportunities to improve on the process of embedding payloads in standalone implants that can elevate their survival levels.\n\nElfPack is one such development in the static payload embedding and loading tailored for adversary simulation teams. In our demo we will demonstrate the mechanisms of construction of ELF binaries, focusing on how ELFPack can use sections facilitate a successful stealthy payload hosting, retrieval and loading.\n\nWe will show the concept of ELF section docking, whereby a section containing payload can be independently attached to the payload-agnostic loader. We will further expand the concept to address in-field (re-)attachment of sections to loaders without the use of compilers which may be very useful for long-haul offensive operations.\n\nFurthermore, we will show how ElfPack can be successfully used as an alternative to executable packing when addressing complex payloads and providing teams with options and flexibility in multiple payload delivery scenarios.\n\nWe will demonstrate both detection opportunities and the enhanced evasion features implemented in a ElfPack proof-of-concept loader and injector tooling.\n\nWe feel that ElfPack and section docking in general can help solve some of the payload bundling challenges for the offensive operators, and also introduce ideas to hunters to detect and respond to this technique.",
