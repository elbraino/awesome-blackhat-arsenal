  "Description": "With CASPR, we are addressing the Supply Chain Attacks by Left Shifting the code signing process.\nCASPR aims to provide simple scripts and services architecture to ensure all code changes in an organization are signed by trusted keys; trustability of these keys should be instantly verifiable every time the code changes are consumed. It also makes the auditing and accountability of code-changes easier and cryptographically verifiable, leaving no scope for malicious actors to sneak in untrusted code at any point in the Software Development Life Cycle.",
