  "Description": "A collaborative free open-source Command & Control development framework that allows developers to concentrate on the core function and goal of their C2.\nZuthaka presents a simplified API for fast and clear integration of C2s and provides a centralized management for multiple C2 instances through a unified interface for Red Team operations.\nZuthaka is more than just a collection of C2s, it is also a solid foundation that can be built upon and easily customized to meet the needs of the exercise that needs to be accomplished. This integration framework for C2 allows developers to concentrate on a unique target environment and not have to reinvent the wheel.\nAfter we first presented Zuthakas' MVP at Black Hat USA 2021, we are now presenting the first release with a live demo lab to share the possibilities of integration and flexibility of Red Team infrastructure.",
