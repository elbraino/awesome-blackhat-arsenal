  "Description": "The Dependency Combobulator is a modular and extensible framework to detect and prevent dependency confusion leakage and potential attacks. This facilitates a holistic approach for ensuring secure application releases that can be evaluated against different sources (e.g., GitHub, Artifactory) and many package management schemes (e.g., ndm, pip, maven).\n\n\nThe framework can be used by security auditors, and pentesters and even baked into an enterprise's application security program and release cycle in an automated fashion.\n\nThis major new release will include support for a new line of package schemes/artifact ingestion.",
