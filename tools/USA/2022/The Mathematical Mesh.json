  "Description": "The Mathematical Mesh is a Threshold Key Infrastructure that allows cryptographic applications to provide effortless security. Threshold key generation and threshold key agreement are used to provide end-to-end security of data in transmission and data at rest without requiring any additional user interactions.\n\nOnce a device is connected to a user's personal Mesh through a simple, one-time configuration step, all private key and credential management functions are automated. Devices may be provisioned with private keys required to support applications such as OpenPGP, S/MIME and SSH according to intended use of that device.",
