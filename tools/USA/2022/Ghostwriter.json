  "Description": "Ghostwriter is a part of your team. It enables collaborative management of penetration test and red team assessments. It helps you manage the critical pieces of every project, including client information, project plans, infrastructure, findings, and reports in one application.\n\nSince its debut at BHUSA Arsenal in 2019, Ghostwriter has grown and matured. Last year was a building year for the project. Now, the development team is excited to re-introduce Ghostwriter with new features to be rolled out in Q1 and Q2 2022 \u2013 such as a new GraphQL API! This new version gives teams the power to manage their projects via the API layer and custom scripts or integration with third-party projects.",
