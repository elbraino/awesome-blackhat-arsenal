  "Description": "LATMA is a tool for offline detection and investigation of lateral movement attack based on AD event logs. The tool assists security teams to overcome the main challenges:\n\nData collection and preparation: in theory, event logs are an available data source to look for authentication anomalies. In practice, however, the source and destination machines are not represented in the same manner (hostname vs. IP), which prevents the ability to directly detect movement of a user account across different machines. LATMA conforms the representation of the source and destination machines, making the even log ready for analysis which is the tool's primary objectives.\n\nData analysis: LATMA scans the even data, looking for authentication patterns we have learned to be associated with lateral movement. For example, a chain of authentications where a single account logs from machine A to machine B and consecutively from machine B to C. Another example is what we call White-Cane in which an account logs from a single source to multiple destinations one after the other. The patterns LATMA searches for are based on our analysis of attacks in the wild, as well as on novel detection algorithm we have developed.\n\nLATMA can be used in any environment where Kerberos and NTLM auditing is enabled, making it an easy and useful tool to any security professionals that handle an Active Directory environment. Offline analysis of authentications, while not real-time, is an efficient method to hunt for active lateral movement that goes under the radar and can provide the means to contain it before it reaches its objectives.",
