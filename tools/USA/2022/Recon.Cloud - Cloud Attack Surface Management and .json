  "Description": "Recon.Cloud is a public and free AWS cloud security reconnaissance tool that will enable users to reveal publicly exposed cloud assets on any domain. There are many tools in the market that are open to users for reconnaissance efforts, but there are few that specifically scope recon efforts to look at the cloud alone. Typical recon tools provide an exhaustive list of all assets they detect – there is no scope to define the cloud assets themselves. This leaves users overwhelmed with too much information that can be difficult and time-consuming to comb through.",
