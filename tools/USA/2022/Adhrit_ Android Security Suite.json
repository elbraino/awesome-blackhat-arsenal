Adhrit has been built with a focus on flexibility and modularization. It currently uses the Ghera benchmarks to identify vulnerable code patterns in the bytecode. Apart from bytecode scanning, Adhrit can also identify hardcoded secrets within Android applications. The tool also comes with a built-in integration to popular software like Jira and Slack which can be configured to automate and streamline.",
