🔗 **Link:** [All Talk, AI Action: Binary Analysis Toolkit MCP Server](https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-Group/Adversarial_Examples_Papers)  
📝 **Description:** In the fields of cybersecurity and reverse engineering, traditional integrations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with tools like IDA Pro have faced significant challenges. Existing solutions not only heavily depend on manual intervention—requiring time-consuming, function-by-function analysis via the IDA Pro GUI—but also fail to effectively combine static and dynamic analysis. By exclusively focusing on static analysis, these methods risk overlooking crucial insights that dynamic analysis could reveal, resulting in a limited and fragmented approach.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative framework centered around an MCP Server, serving as a unified interface. This approach transforms the LLM into a fully autonomous intelligent agent capable of managing a complete binary analysis workflow while drastically reducing human effort. Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates both static and dynamic analysis tools into a collaborative pipeline, ensuring a comprehensive examination of binary files. Additionally, utilizing the MCP Server enhances code reusability and scalability, aligning the process more closely with professional reverse engineering practices.

Key Points:
- Automation: Delegates the entire analysis process to the LLM with minimal human intervention.
- Comprehensive Analysis: Combines static and dynamic analysis to uncover deeper insights.
- Tool Reusability: Leverages a unified MCP Server interface to improve portability and scalability.

This paradigm shift in tool integration not only addresses the inherent shortcomings of traditional methods but also paves the way for a more efficient and thorough binary analysis system.

📝 **Description:** Agentic workflows represent a new frontier in how AI systems operate, moving beyond simple task completion toward iterative, dynamic processes. Unlike zero-shot prompting, where an LLM completes a single task in isolation, agentic workflows incorporate loops, branching decisions, and continuous refinement, making them particularly effective for complex domains like cybersecurity. Security workflows often demand more than linear task execution—they require sophisticated orchestration, adaptability, and collaboration between tools, agents, and functions to address challenges like incident investigation or attack path traversal.

In this talk, I will introduce Floki, an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation and orchestration of agentic workflows. Built on Dapr, Floki provides a powerful platform for researchers and developers to experiment with LLM-based autonomous agents. It enables agents to function as independent, self-contained units using Dapr's Virtual Actor pattern, eliminating concurrency concerns while seamlessly integrating into larger workflows. Floki also supports collaboration through Pub/Sub messaging, allowing agents to communicate efficiently and work together toward shared goals.

Using real-world security examples, we will explore how Floki facilitates deterministic and non-deterministic workflows, event-driven interactions, and chat-based agentic collaboration. From task chaining to fan-out/fan-in patterns, I'll demonstrate how Floki empowers researchers and practitioners to design and deploy agentic workflows that address the unique challenges of cybersecurity operations. This talk aims to provide both conceptual insights and practical guidance for advancing research and implementation in multi-agent systems.

🔗 **Link:** [DNSForge – Intercept Credentials on Windows Networks](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/DNSForge)  
📝 **Description:** DNSForge is a network penetration testing tool that introduces a novel tactic to intercept and manipulate name resolution requests made to the authoritative DNS server in an internal network environment. DNSForge achieves interception and reuse of Windows user credentials without any user interaction. While existing poisoning attacks target fallback protocols (such as LLMNR and NBT-NS) or DNS over IPv6, DNSForge employs manipulations on layer 2 to target the primary DNS protocol over IPv4. This enables the tool to bypass current mitigations against existing poisoning attacks as it imitates a legitimate response to name resolutions requests over DNS. Hence, the non-interactive, vulnerable-by-design and seemingly legitimate elements of this attack ensure higher success rates as compared to traditional poisoning attacks.

📝 **Description:** Google Drive in recent years has become one of the most abused platforms for threat actors to conduct illegal and malicious activity. Threat actors use Google accounts to launch, store, and log malware, effectively turning Drive into a command and control center. On the side of legal and ethical activity, Google Drive remains a popular platform for security researchers to store these artifacts in summarized write-ups and spreadsheets of malicious and illegal activity observed. Much like an archaeologist looks for artifacts providing clues of the history of civilization, security researchers look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which are clues to what a threat actor has done. Security engineers have worked across decades to build out tooling to analyze hard drives and network resources; however, similar advances to analyze Google Drive resources have remained underdeveloped. Along the same line, tools that aggregate and summarize collections of records on IOCs stored in Google Drive by researchers are also lacking.
The GDIOCSpider (Google Drive IOC Spider) provides a tool for both of these use cases. This open-source, configurable, Python tool is capable of crawling through an entire Google Drive, analyzing its file contents, and searching for various defined IOC (Indicators of Compromise) types to extract. This tool outputs a summary of all discovered artifacts across all files, erasing the need for security researchers to manually sift through cloud stores. Supplementing the compromised account use case, the same tool can be used to aggregate IOCs collected in personal or corporate Google Drive accounts in the form of case records gathered by security researchers. This 'environment agnostic' approach is how GDIOCSpider enables security researchers to perform efficient IOC research in Google Drive.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Wireless networks (802.11) are indispensable in today's communication systems. However, their inherent vulnerabilities generally pose significant security threats. Specifically, detecting Rogue (Fake) Access Points and Hidden Access Points can be very challenging, as these unauthorized entities can facilitate malicious activities once they infiltrate a network. This study addresses these issues by providing a solution named GhostBeacon, an innovative tool that is designed to detect such malicious access points effectively. GhostBeacon mainly consists of two primary modules: the Rogue (Fake) Access Point Spotter, which analyses Beacon Frames using couple of parameters to identify Rogue Access Points; and the Hidden Access Point Spotter, which analyses Probe Request/Response frames to uncover access points with hidden SSIDs. Experimental tests show that GhostBeacon achieves a detection success rate of up to 99% for Rogue Access Points and nearly 100% for Hidden Access Points. These results highlight this project's potential to enhance wireless network security by mitigating unauthorized access and the subsequent risk of harmful network activities.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Fault Injection (FI) attacks have been around since the late 90s but, until recently, they remained largely academic and considered not practical in the real-world. However, the popularity of these attacks has been growing for the last 10 years and today it is common to see them, not just in academia, but in security congresses and real-world attacks.

Despite this popularity, hardware hackers still do not have a reliable open-source tool for mounting FI attacks. Open-source tools already available are, either very limited, or they are just PoCs which cannot be easily adapted. Without better options, many hackers have to develop their own tools for fault injection, which requires a lot of time and deviates the effort from the actual target research.

We present Glitch.IO, a powerful, flexible and cheap glitcher that aims to be a standard in the hardware hackers toolbox.
Glitch.IO is not just a hardware able to inject glitches, it is also a software framework designed to facilitate the coding of FI test applications. It includes a library FI attacks - called "recipes" - to facilitate the reproduction of publicly known attacks.

During the presentation we will introduce the tool and demonstrate how to use a "recipe" to break the JTAG protection of a microcontroller or to characterise and bypass the Raspberry Pico 2 FI countermeasures.

📝 **Description:** Software security is constantly challenged by the difficulty of upgrading third party libraries. Codebases often lag several major versions behind, and the value of upgrading is frequently debated. A more practical approach can be backporting vulnerability fixes to the specific versions in use. Manually backporting security patches is a time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive task for security and development teams. Our method utilizes LLM capabilities in combination with other techniques to efficiently streamline this process at scale, efficiently mitigating vulnerabilities across hundreds of packages by backporting thousands of fixes. Instead of requiring researchers to manually locate, isolate, and apply patches, our AI-powered system automates much of the workflow: understanding the patch, identifying the relevant code in the Git repository, applying the necessary changes, running tests, and iterating until the CVE is successfully patched and its corresponding unit tests pass. While LLMs offer a powerful new capability, they also present challenges. This talk will explore what works, what doesn't, and the advantages and disadvantages of using AI models for vulnerability backporting. We'll share real-world successes, discuss unexpected AI errors, and explain how we addressed gaps in test coverage. By collaborating with cybersecurity researchers, our AI-driven approach not only accelerates security patching but also ensures that critical fixes are applied without introducing breaking changes.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** A successful ransomware attack is the culmination of numerous steps performed by a determined attacker: gaining initial access to the victim's environment, enumerating privileges to identify sensitive data, escalating privileges to gain access to the identified data, and finally encrypting the original data before demanding the ransom payment (with the optional exfiltration step beforehand if an extortion play is on the table).

The encryption process itself is straightforward. After the data is accessed, a cryptographic key (usually an asymmetric key) is used to encrypt the original data, rendering the data unrecoverable by any identity not possessing the key. If the attacker first downloads the data to be used as a potential extortion leverage during the ransom process, this requires attacker-controlled infrastructure to support this data transfer and storage outside the victim's environment, all while attempting to evade any potential outbound data transfer alerting mechanisms in the target's environment.

What if this was not necessary and the attacker could simply use the victim's own infrastructure while nullifying them any access to the data? Creativity is key when discovering new ways to attack a target, achieving a goal with little detection while using the least amount of resources.

Permiso's P0 Labs research team identified several ways to abuse features allowed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service) to encrypt data on a target's buckets as part of a ransomware attack. This blog will touch upon detection opportunities that might help defenders mitigate these attack vectors through the help of RansomWhen, a new open-source tool we are releasing to aid all organizations in detecting usage of these ransomware TTPs in CloudTrail logs and enumerating identities that possess specific combinations of privileges corresponding to these TTPs.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Modern websites have become a tangled mess of intricate network architectures—creating fertile ground for serious, protocol-level vulnerabilities that traditional tools often overlook.
As web applications continue to grow in complexity, we see the rise of critical vulnerabilities like smuggling, first-request routing, and cache poisoning/deception and the need for a tool that treats HTTP as what it really is: a stream based protocol.

While security professionals rely on HTTP proxies to intercept, analyze, and manipulate traffic, most of these solutions abstract away the stream-based nature of the protocol. By presenting request-response pairs as isolated transactions, they hide crucial details such as persistent connections, pipelining and geo-routing, making it difficult to fully understand how data truly flows—or to uncover advanced attack vectors.

To address these challenges, I developed HTTP Raider, an open source Burp Suite extension that helps you explore and exploit your target's underlying protocol logic with ease. It surfaces hidden details like persistent connections and pipelining, and provides absolute clarity on what's happening under the hood, empowering you to take your attacks further and exploit critical vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain undetected.

Additionally, HTTP Raider leverages error- and timing-based analyses to detect concealed proxies, caching layers, and cloud infrastructures—offering a holistic view of the network infrastructure.Through a drag-and-drop interface, users can model the flow of messages across multiple components, predicting how traffic is transformed and routed.

By removing the guesswork inherent in conventional proxies and empowering testers with a low-level view of HTTP, this tool ultimately promotes true protocol mastery—enabling researchers to discover and exploit critical vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain undetected.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** HarmonyOS NEXT is the next generation operating system developed by Huawei. It completely removes the Android AOSP code and is incompatible with Android applications. In addition, it has developed a new operating system kernel, which will cover more than one billion devices in the future. Because HarmonyOS NEXT has a new compiler, interpreter, file format and instruction set architecture, it makes the previous program analysis tools invalid. In addition, the information and documents of the new system are very limited, which makes it difficult for security analysts to conduct security analysis and risk assessment quickly and effectively.

To solve this problem, we read the source code of ArkCompiler, the compiler of HarmonyOS NEXT. We summarized the detailed process of ArkCompiler compilation. It takes arkTS (a variant of typescript) as input, translates it into Panda Bytecode, and finally executes it in the ecma virtual machine. It is also designed to support JIT and AOT functions. In addition, we also have a deep understanding of its AST, IR, assembly, executable files, and the design ideas of compilation optimization design.

Based on this, we developed the ArkCompiler decompilation tool named arkdecompiler, which takes Panda Binary File as input, parses Panda Bytecode, and then translates it into Panda IR. After having IR, we can do various analyses. Based on IR, we reversely construct the native arkTS AST tree, and then we traverse the AST tree and translate it into native arkTS source code. At present, we have implemented support for common binary operation instructions.

To be more specifically, we will talk about:
- ArkCompiler's overall process and key components such as AST, IR, bytecode.
- How to translate Panda Bytecode into Panda IR using existing components of ArkCompiler.
- How to automatically reverse build the ArkTS AST tree based on Panda IR.
- After having the AST tree, how do we convert it into ArkTS source code.

In order to demonstrate the capabilities of our framework and tools, we prepared some cases, including a demo written in arkTS, compiled into Panda Bytecode using ArkCompiler, and restored to native ArkTS code using our tool Arkcompiler.

In order to allow more people to participate, quickly improve the project and make it more powerful, so as to improve the efficiency of security analysts, we will release the source code of the tool. In the future, we hope that our work can make the HarmonyOS system and its applications more secure.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** This is the 4.0 (and Final) version of the ParseAndC tool (whose 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 versions were presented in the Black Hat Arsenal 2021/2022/2023 (SecTor) and DEFCON 2021). The 1.0 version was capable of mapping any C structure(s) to any datastream, and then visually displaying the 1:1 correspondence between the variables and the data in a very colorful, intuitive display so that it was very easy to understand which field had what value. In 2.0 version, we introduced dynamic structures which essentially expanded the C language semantics (not syntax) so that now C structures alone had the same power as full-fledged C programs. In 3.0 version, we completed the parsing part of the tool by adding a ton of new or missing features that cover various quirks of C language so that the tool now worked on ANY production C code.

What problems are we solving in this new 4.0 version?

The main problem we solve is that often there is a huge gap between the way any data is stored, and the way it needs to be displayed to make sense to the end-users. While writing a parser, after you "parse" (read in) the data, for "simple" kind of data you can display the data just like that without any manipulation (for example, the integer variable "PacketSizeBytes" can be displayed just like that, and people will immediately understand its value. However, often there are other type of not-so-simple data where just by displaying the data in the native format, it does not convey the real measure of what the data represents. For example, suppose an integer stores the number of seconds since a certain event. Just seeing 465827 sec doesn't give a proper sense of how long the time is, but converting it to a human-readable 5 days 9 hrs 23 min 47 sec does. So, for such cases, merely proper "parsing" (reading in) the data is not enough - we also need to write additional code (either within the Parser itself, or pipe the native format into yet another shell script) to display the value in a custom format. In C, the only two native ways to store data are integer and float, but we need this custom format for many other cases. Some examples:

- Suppose an int represents a memory address, and you would rather see its value displayed in Hex format.
- Suppose an int represents a mask, and you would rather see its value in the binary format.
- Support an int stores the Unix timestamp of a certain event. Just seeing how many seconds have passed since 1/1/1970 is not very telling, it would make far more sense if we convert it to a human-readable YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS or something like that.
- Suppose a float contains the temperature of the chip in Kelvin, but the user of the tool would rather see the unit in Fahrenheit.
- Suppose an int contain the # of days since a particular Sunday, and instead of knowing the day count, the user would rather want to know which day of the week (Sun/Mon/Tue etc.) it is because that's all he/she cares about.
- Suppose an int contains the IPv4 protocol number, but instead of just displaying the numeric protocol numbers like 1/6/17/46, , you would rather display the corresponding protocol names like ICMP/TCP/UDP/RSVP etc.
- Suppose an int actually represents the 4 octets of an IP address, and the user rather see it in the A.B.C.D format.
- It is a char array, and instead of seeing their numeric values, the user would rather see their corresponding ASCII chars.
- The number(s) are coded in certain encoding (say Binary-Coded-Decimal or Base-64), and the user would want to see the decoded values.

C offers printf for doing certain limited manipulations while displaying the data via format string, but that's it. For example, it cannot automatically display the #sec into day:HH:MM:SS format. For each of those custom display manipulation, one would need to write extra code in the Parser, or pipe the parsed data (in native format) to yet another shell script that will manipulate the native data into custom display format. This process is laborious and error prone. Why? Since the code for manipulating the variable value is located in a different place than where the variable is declared, chances are high that coders will make cut-and-paste errors (use wrong variable names or attributes etc.).

Here, we CO-LOCATE the output display format of the data in the same place where they are declared, and the beauty is that, we do it without breaking the C syntax. We optionally annotate every variable declaration with a "format" or "TAG", where the TAG tells how the variable will be displayed. And since we are not allowed to break the existing C syntax, we put this TAG within the C comment that starts on same line of the variable declaration. A C preprocessor usually discards the comments, but our tool also parses the comments, and if it finds any custom display tag annotation, it will display it accordingly.

To recap on the new capabilities of this tool, earlier the tool used to display the data in the native C formats (integers and floating points), but in current version 4.0 we now have the ability to display the internally stored data into ANY output format we like. For most common type of display formats, this tool gives builtin formats, and for others, it gives the users a way specify it dynamically. You will no longer need to pipe the output to yet another Python/Perl/SED/TR/AWK/Shell script to display the data in the intended format. In other words, this tool is now your ONE-STOP-SHOP for parsing and interpreting the data you are getting from your testing. ANY AND ALL KIND OF TESTING - SW, FW OR HW, Security- or non-Security testing.

The output formats (TAG) that have been added are:

(Reviewer - please note that in this submission, I am using {FORMAT} and {/FORMAT} while in real-life the "{" and "}" would be replaced by "less-than-symbol" and "greater-than-symbol" for this tool. The reason I am forced to do this is because this Black Hat submission website has input sanitization rules which treats them as valid HTML tags and starts interpreting it.

1) Built-in formats: HEX, OCT, BIN, DEC, PERCENT – to display the data as Hexadecimal, Octal, Binary, Decimal, and Percent. So, if you declare a variable like int I; /* {FORMAT} BIN {/FORMAT}*/, then in the output its value would get displayed in binary.
2) Built-in Time formats: MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, UNIXDATETIME, EXCELDATETIME – to display the time into a human readable format involving year, month, day, hour, minute, second etc. (fully customizable). For example, if we have a declaration like int TS; /* {FORMAT} UNIXDATETIME {/FORMAT} */, then the tool will treat this TS variable as a unix timestamp and display its value as YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS. It is extremely flexible, for example, if you give {FORMAT} UNIXDATETIME("Date is MM/DD/YY, and time is HH-mm-SS"){/FORMAT}, for TS=1741977744, your output will be "Date is 03/14/25, and time is 18-42-24" (basically exactly the supplied argument string, with its various tokens like MM, DD, YY etc. replaced with the corresponding values.). Please note that Microsoft Excel stores the timestamp in a different way (a float representing the number of full and fractional days since Dec 31, 1899), and we handle it.
3) BCD format: To decode data encoded in Binary-Coded-Decimal. This tool provides built-in support for ALL varieties of BCD (viz. "8 4 2 1 (XS-0)" ,"7 4 2 1" ,"Aiken (2 4 2 1)" ,"Excess-3 (XS-3)" ,"Excess-6 (XS-6)" ,"Jump-at-2 (2 4 2 1)" ,"Jump-at-8 (2 4 2 1)" ,"4 2 2 1 (I)" ,"4 2 2 1 (II)" ,"5 4 2 1" ,"5 2 2 1" ,"5 1 2 1" ,"5 3 1 1" ,"White (5 2 1 1)" ,"5 2 1 1" ,"Magnetic tape" ,"Paul" ,"Gray" ,"Glixon" ,"Ledley" ,"4 3 1 1" ,"LARC" ,"Klar" ,"Petherick (RAE)" ,"O'Brien I (Watts)" ,"5-cyclic" ,"Tompkins I" ,"Lippel" ,"O'Brien II" ,"Tompkins II" ,"Excess-3 Gray" ,"6 3  2  1 (I)" ,"6 3  2  1 (II)" ,"8 4  2  1" ,"Lucal" ,"Kautz I" ,"Kautz II" ,"Susskind I" ,"Susskind II")
4) BASE64 format: To decode data encoded in Base-64 format. Obviously, this only works on array because we are talking about converting 8-bits into 6-bits.
5) PRINTF format: Basically, giving the user the full power of the C function printf(), and much more. We have also incorporated the more powerful features from other languages in this. For example, Python allows "+" to concatenate strings, and "*" to repeat strings, which we allow here in printf format string specification.
6) ENUM format: If the code has enum in it, the tool automatically displays the corresponding enum literals instead of the variable values (this is massively helpful). In addition, even if the C struct did not have any enum declared, here we can allow an display enum to be declared specifically for that variable. Combining the C enum and C switch statements, where we depending on the value of the data, we display a certain literal instead. For example. Suppose we store the privilege level of a device driver in an integer called Ring, and instead of displaying 0 and 3, we want display "KMD" and "UMD". In our tool, we just declare it as int Ring; /* {FORMAT} ENUM("KMD"=0, "UMD"=3) {/FORMAT} */, it will display it accordingly.
7) POSTPROCESS format: This is the most powerful where you can pretty much write any code based on the stored value. You no longer need to pipe the output to yet another script. For example, if variable temp stores the temperature in Kelvin but we want to display it in Fahrenheit, then int tempKelvin; /* {FORMAT} POSTPROCESS((tempKelvin-273.15)*1.8+32) {/FORMAT}*/ will do the job.

We also introduce the "_X_" operator within these formats. Most of the errors in parser writing happens due to cut-and-paste error (if a C struct has 20 fields, there is no way the coder is going to freshly type the 20 printf statements to display their values - the coder is going to type it once for one variable, and then for the rest 19 variables he/she is going to simply copy the first printf statement, and do the necessary changes. However, many a times the coders forget to make the necessary changes. For example, suppose a very simple struct has two int variables "height" and "weight", two words that differ by a single character. While printing their values, a coder can easily make the following mistake:

printf("height is %d", height);
printf("weight is %d", height);

To avoid these kind of errors, in this 4.0 version, we introduce the "_X_" operator. During runtime, this _X_ will get substituted with the corresponding variable name. For example, look at the struct below which our tool will understand just fine:

struct S {
int height; // {FORMAT} PRINTF("%d",_X_) {/FORMAT}
int weight; // {FORMAT} PRINTF("%d",_X_) {/FORMAT}
};

Another great feature we add is that all these TAGs or formats can be applied one after another on the same variable. So, suppose a variable contains a unix timestamp, and we are only interested in knowing how many days were in that month, and we want the display that many "=" symbols. For example, suppose we know that the timestamp corresponds to a day in the month of December. Since December has 31 days, we want to display "===============================". We can achieve this very elegantly here:

int TimeStamp; /* {FORMAT} UNIXDATETIME("MM") {/FORMAT}
{FORMAT} POSTPROCESS(int(_X_)) {/FORMAT}
{FORMAT} ENUM(31=1,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31) {/FORMAT}
{FORMAT} PRINTF(_X_*"=") {/FORMAT} */

The first {FORMAT} UNIXDATETIME("MM") {/FORMAT} extracts the date in the MM form (two-digit numeric string).
The second {FORMAT} POSTPROCESS(int(_X_)) {/FORMAT} converts that two-digit numeric string to a number (for example, converting a "09" to 9)
The third {FORMAT} ENUM(31=1,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31) {/FORMAT} tells how many days to display for that month (observe that month starts from 1, not 0).
The fourth {FORMAT} PRINTF{_X_*"="} simply prints that many "=" symbols.

This is essentially equivalent of writing sequential code, line after line. The output from previous format gets fed into the next format. This way, you can pretty much write ANY code to custom display your variable RIGHT where the variable declaration is happening. So, the chances of messing it up is indeed very low. And, it is Turing-complete.

Last but not the least, whenever we print a custom display value, we display BOTH the original (native) value and the manipulated (formatted) value. You can see it on the console and in the CSV file. So, we are actually not changing the internal value.

Just click on the "Run Demo" button and see for yourself.

This tool is extremely portable – it's a single Python 2MB text file, is cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Unix), and also works in the terminal /batch mode without GUI or Internet connection. The tool is self-contained - it doesn't import anything, to the extent that it implements its own C compiler (front-end) from scratch!!

This tool is useful for both security- and non-security testing alike (reverse engineering, network traffic analyzing, packet processing etc.). It is currently being used at Intel widely. The author of this tool led many security hackathons at Intel and there this tool was found to be very useful.

📝 **Description:** Plaguards was developed to address a critical need within Incident Response (IR) teams, specifically in handling obfuscated PowerShell scripts—a frequent component in modern malware and ransomware attacks that severely threaten business operations. Despite the availability of numerous deobfuscation tools for JavaScript, there is a notable shortage of static deobfuscation resources for PowerShell, especially amidst the increasing trend of fileless PowerShell-based attacks observed throughout 2024. This gap has left IR teams without effective tools to manage these high-stakes threats.

Most existing tools only focus on detecting obfuscated PowerShell rather than fully deobfuscating it, leaving a crucial aspect of analysis unaddressed. Plaguards fills this void, enabling automated deobfuscation specifically tailored to PowerShell scripts. It empowers IR teams to swiftly parse through obfuscated lines, identify embedded Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like IP addresses and URLs, and determine if they represent legitimate threats or false positives.

Beyond deobfuscation, Plaguards enhances the overall response workflow by providing templated PDF reports, documenting each deobfuscated line and cross-referencing IOCs with threat intelligence. This capability not only aids in real-time threat assessment but also supports IR teams by delivering comprehensive, actionable insights in a clear and organized format.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Shellcode is omnipresent, a constant part of the exploitation and malware ecosystem. Injected into process memory, there are innumerable possibilities. Yet until recently, analysis techniques were severely lacking. We present SHAREM, an NSA-funded shellcode analysis framework with stunning capabilities that have revolutionized how we approach the analysis of shellcode.

SHAREM can emulate shellcode, identifying more than 30,000 WinAPI functions as well as 99% of Windows syscalls. This emulation data can also be ingested by its own custom disassembler, allowing for functions and parameters to be identified in the disassembly for the first time ever. The quality of disassembly produced by SHAREM is virtually flawless, markedly superior to what is produced by leading disassemblers. In comparison, IDA Pro or Ghidra might produce a vague "CALL EDX," as opposed to identifying what specific function and parameters is being called, a highly non-trivial task when dealing with shellcode.

One obstacle with analyzing shellcode can be obfuscation, as an encoded shellcode may be a series of indecipherable bytes—a complete mystery. SHAREM can easily overcome this, presenting the fully decoded form in the disassembler, unlocking all its secrets. Without executing the shellocode, emulation can be used to help fully deobfuscate the shellcode. In short, a binary shellcode – or even the ASCII text representing a shellcode – could be taken and quickly analyzed, to discover its true, hidden functionality.

One game-changing innovation is complete code coverage. With SHAREM, we ensure that all code is executed, capturing function calls and arguments that would otherwise be impossible to get. This is done by taking a series of snapshots of memory and CPU register context; these are restored if a shellcode ends with unreached code. In practical terms, this means if a shellcode ordinarily would prematurely terminate, we might miss out several malicious functions. Complete code coverage allows us to rewind and restart at specific points we should not be able to reach, discovering all functionality.

New to be unveiled at Arsenal, SHAREM will now optionally integrate AI to help resolve what exactly is going on. The previously enumerated APIs and parameters—along with disassembly and discovered artifacts--can be analyzed to identify malicious techniques, which may be found in MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The ease and simplicity of SHAREM is breathtaking, especially comparison to how much time and effort similar analysis would require otherwise. What might previously require expertise and take extended time for analysis can now be reduced to seconds. SHAREM represents a game-changing shift in our capability to analyze shellcode in a highly efficient manner, documenting every possible clue – whether it be functions, parameters, or artifacts.

For reverse engineers of all kinds, SHAREM is a must-see presentation.

🔗 **Link:** [Automating Red Team Operations in Windows AD with Local LLM and Multi AI Agents](https://github.com/daqcri/deeper-lite/blob/master/python/BenchmarkDatasets/DBLP_ACM/ACM.csv)  
📝 **Description:** Modern Red Team assessments in Windows Active Directory (AD) environments often involve navigating a vast array of machines, accounts, making them highly resource-intensive. To streamline these engagements, I developed a prototype automated penetration testing tool that leverages local Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized AI Agents. Because AD environments often contain large amounts of confidential data, this solution can operate entirely within a closed environment, mitigating the risk of data leakage. I verified that the system runs effectively on a single PC.

A fundamental challenge with local LLMs is that they often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge, particularly with regard to attacker tools and methodologies. I address this limitation by restricting the set of utilized tools (e.g., Mimikatz, Psexec, PowerView) and designing specialized Agents for each. I also enhance the models' reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines that focus on typical AD attack paths. Each Agent is based on the ReAct model and logs its thought process and executed commands to visualize the flow of reasoning.

Beyond the immediate goal of reducing the effort required for Red Team operations, this research also examines a future threat vector. I anticipate that adversaries will soon embed local LLMs into malware, enabling offline attacks on isolated machines—such as web-isolated hosts or local networks. These attacks do not generate network traffic, thereby evading detection by security appliances that monitor outbound traffic. To evaluate the potential efficacy of local AI-driven automation—given that most Windows devices are equipped only with a CPU—this tool will be tested using a model that runs on the CPU.

🔗 **Link:** [BOAZ: Development of a Multilayered Evasion Tool and Methodology](https://github.com/ICTMCG/Awesome-Machine-Generated-Text/blob/main/README.md)  
📝 **Description:** BOAZ (Bypass, Obfuscate, Adapt, Zero-Trust) evasion was inspired by the concept of multi-layered approach which is the evasive version of defence-in-depth first proposed by at BH USA14 [1]. BOAZ was developed to provide greater control over combinations of evasion methods, enabling more granular evaluations against antivirus and EDR. It is designed to bypass both before and during execution detections that span signature, heuristic and behavioural detection techniques [2].

BOAZ supports both x86/x64 binary (PE) or raw payload as input and output EXE or DLL. It has been tested on separated Window-11 Enterprise, Windows-10 and windows Server 2022 VMs (version: 22H2, 22621.1992) with 14 Desktop AVs and 7 EDRs installed include Windows Defender, Norton, BitDefender, Sophos and ESET. The design of BOAZ evasion is modular, so users can add their own toolset or techniques to the framework. One advantage of this approach is that if a specific technique's signature become known to antivirus, researchers can easily adjust the technique to verify it and either improve or target a new technique to that detection. This process is described as a query-modify-query attack process, where the attacker can improve based on the feedback from black-box engines until their sample is fully undetectable (FUD) [3].

BOAZ is written in C++ and C and uses Python3 as the main linker to integrate all modules. There have been significant improvements implemented since its inception. The new features of the BOAZ evasion tool, set to be released at BH Asia 2025, include two novel process injection primitives, along with newly implemented loaders and behavioural evasion techniques. There will be a major update to the BH USA 2025 version, including some new anti-forensic techniques and more new process injection threadless execution primitives.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** DeadMatter is a specialized tool written in C#, designed to extract sensitive information such as password hashes of active logon sessions, from memory dumps. It employs carving techniques to retrieve credentials from various file types such as process or full memory dumps, either in raw or minidump format, decompressed hibernation files, virtual machine memory files, or other types of files that may contain logon credentials.

This tool is particularly useful for penetration testers, red teamers, and forensic investigators, as it facilitates the analysis of system security vulnerabilities and aids in digital forensic investigations. DeadMatter can be very useful to pentesters and red teamers during their engagements, since they often have to deal with EDR and AV software detecting and/or blocking their attempts to dump the LSASS process memory in the minidump format. The alternative of dumping and exfiltrating a full memory dump is often not an option. As a result, DeadMatter was created to fill the gap and allow the offensive team to parse the memory dump files directly on the victim machine, in order to extract NTLM hashes on the spot.

This demo will focus on obtaining an LDAP session via SMB relaying, which can then be used to identify ESC vulnerabilities through Metasploit's expanded ldap_vulnerable_cert_finder module. Using the results from the vulnerable cert finder module, we will demonstrate how to detect and exploit ESC15 (the newest ESC vulnerable certificate template flaw) in order to obtain a certificate that can be used to open a Windows Meterpreter session. While opening the Meterpreter session we will demonstrate using Sysmon how the Windows Meterpreter no longer makes calls to CreateRemoteThread and instead uses the PoolParty injection technique to more effectively inject into the target process.

Going back to our LDAP session, we will run a query to identify SCCM servers in the target Active Directory environment. Once identified, we will demonstrate Metasploit's new SCCM attack workflow, which leverages new SMB-to-HTTP relaying capabilities. Using Metasploit's SMB-to-HTTP relay server, we will relay an NTLM authentication attempt for a newly created computer account to the SCCM HTTP authentication server. After successfully authenticating, we will retrieve Network Access Account (NAA) credentials from the SCCM server, as these are often found in domain environments with higher privileges than they require making them a prime target for lateral movement.

🔗 **Link:** [ROP ROCKET: Advanced Framework for Return-Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Bw3ll/ROP_ROCKET)  
📝 **Description:** ROP ROCKET is a groundbreaking, next-generation tool for Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), boasting unparalleled capabilities. This tool introduces several innovative techniques, including a novel approach to invoking Heaven's Gate via ROP, which facilitates the transition from x86 to x64 architecture, and invoking Windows syscalls via ROP to evade Data Execution Prevention (DEP), eliminating the need for less stealthy Windows API functions.

The focal point of this tool is automatic ROP chain generation—constructing complete ROP exploits. Moreover, with this tool, we pioneer several new ROP techniques, including both x86 and x64 Heaven's Gate and using Windows syscalls to bypass DEP. To overcome DEP, we automate chain generation for Windows syscalls NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. In addition, ROP ROCKET can avoid the need to bypass DEP by chaining multiple APIs together to achieve shellcode-like functionality.

For Black Hat Arsenal 2025, we will unveil support for building ROP chains for many new WinAPIs: WinExec, DeleteFileA, CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, URLDownloadToFileA, OpenProcess, Process32First, Process32Next, RegSetKeyValueA, RegCreateKeyA, WriteProcessMemory, HeapCreate, OpenSCManagerA, CreateServiceA, ShellExecuteA, CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx, TerminateProcess, and CreateProcessA. All will be available via automatic ROP chain construction using patterns with PUSHAD or a combination of PUSHAD coupled with mov dereferences, or the sniper approach.

One of the features of ROP ROCKET is the sheer diversity of possibilities in creating these chains, allowing unique and unusual combinations that traditionally might not be achievable by ROP chain automation. The tool uses extensive emulation to evaluate the fitness of individual ROP gadgets, allowing unusual or longer ROP gadgets to be used. It also builds, emulates, and debugs parts of some ROP chains internally to solve certain problems, allowing for ROP chains to be built with the mov dereference or sniper approach, rather than relying simply on the PUSHAD approach. Distances to certain function parameters can also be dynamically calculated and readjusted with emulation.

Sometimes a ROP chain is feasible only if a ROP gadget's address is free of bad bytes. With ROP ROCKET, we provide a way to obfuscate gadgets, allowing the gadget address to be pushed onto the stack, decoded, and executed at runtime.

ROP ROCKET is built for performance, utilizing multiprocessing to harness a dozen or more cores. It also stores discovered gadgets from previously examined binaries, giving persistence across sessions. With all possible ROP gadgets—our raw ingredients—identified, ROP chains can be formed in seconds.

While ROP can be a complex topic, ROP ROCKET provides powerful capabilities to users. New for Black Hat Arsenal 2025, the tool will support over 100 patterns for different WinAPIs or syscalls, far exceeding the capabilities of other ROP generation tools.

🔗 **Link:** [Dvora](https://github.com/jfrog/Dvora)  
📝 **Description:** Dvora is an open-source Python tool designed to enhance the detection capabilities of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solutions.

While SAST tools are essential for securing source code and detecting vulnerabilities, they primarily rely on predefined patterns and known library functions to analyze vulnerable code flows. This creates a critical blind spot when zero-day vulnerabilities emerge in flows using custom or inline implementations of these dangerous functions (ex. strcpy).

As a result, security vulnerabilities are not flagged by SAST engines, which allow attackers to exploit them. Dvora addresses this gap by analyzing individual functions in compiled ELF binaries and assigning well-known function names (ex. strcpy) for functions that implement the relevant behavior.

The analysis is powered by two main components:
A Unicorn-based emulation engine that can run individual functions straight from a compiled binary on multiple architectures
A set of rules that maps input and output arguments to well-known function names
Following the analysis, Dvora adds the discovered function symbols to the ELF's symbol section, which transparently improves any subsequent runs of other SAST tools.

By identifying risks at the logic level rather than relying solely on known function signatures, Dvora empowers security teams to uncover previously overlooked threats and strengthen application security.

As an open-source initiative, Dvora encourages collaboration from the cybersecurity community to expand its capabilities and continuously improve detection by mapping more library functions and allowing the emulation engine to run on more relevant cases.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** The use of third-party software in organizations has increased dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, new vulnerabilities are published daily. Thus, it is crucial to continuously monitor the security of third-party software. This requires efficient and precise tools to match specific software versions against known vulnerabilities.

To determine a tool to utilize in pentests, we evaluated six tools for retrieving known vulnerabilities: nvdtools, cve-search, CVE Quick Search, Snyk-DB, VulDB and Rapid7-DB.

Surprisingly, we found all to be lacking in some way, identifying mainly three types of problems: tool precision and recall, input restrictions and the lack of exporting functionalities. First, they returned inaccurate results or utilized only one source of information, e.g., lacking information about exploits. Second, they usually require users to adhere to a certain input format like CPEs. This makes them difficult and error-prone to use. Third, meaningfully exporting results was generally not possible.

To address these limitations, we developed search_vulns, which uses text comparison techniques and CPEs in combination to return high-quality results, while not imposing any input restrictions. Moreover, it returns consistent results despite product rebranding and can automatically generate CPEs that have yet to be published. Together with its custom logic for version comparison, this further enhances the quality of search_vulns' results. As it utilizes multiple data sources, unlike most other tools, its results include information about known exploits, backpatches and software recency. Finally, search_vulns provides a fine-granular export of results in different formats.

In conclusion, search_vulns represents a significant improvement over existing tools and benefits various kinds of security analysts in finding known vulnerabilities given only a software name and version. A public web application is available for typical users, while its CLI can be utilized in automated offline workflows. Thus, it has numerous applications in pentests, audits, vulnerability scanners, CI/CD pipelines, SAST or SBOM-analysis.

📝 **Description:** DAPper (Dependency Analysis Project) is an open-source tool to uncover software dependencies – both explicit and implicit – by analyzing source code and system-level data. Unlike most dependency analysis tools that rely on package managers, DAPper identifies dependencies in C/C++ codebases, which typically lack a standardized package registry. It also detects subprocess execution in source code across multiple languages, revealing hidden dependencies that might otherwise go unnoticed.
These features in DAPper are powered by a set of datasets mapping file names to packages across ecosystems like Debian/Ubuntu, NuGet (Windows/.NET), PyPI, and Docker Hub. These datasets, along with tools for generating them, are released as open source, enabling broader use for software inventory analysis/system enumeration, vulnerability impact assessments, and system audits. These datasets can be particularly useful for recognizing packages on systems that lack package manager metadata, such embedded Linux systems or Windows support software used to monitor/manage/configure devices.

🔗 **Link:** [Effective Security Code Reviews in Visual Studio - Introducing Static Analysis Hero (SAH)](https://github.com/bpred754/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/Java/SelectionSort/googleBooks10000.txt)  
📝 **Description:** Static Analysis Hero (SAH) is an extension to Visual Studio Code dedicated to identifying software vulnerabilities and enhancing static source code analysis. Its main features fall into two categories: 1. code scanning (identify vulnerabilities) and 2. integrated documentation (managing vulnerabilities).
Code scanning for vulnerable patterns and potential security vulnerabilities is based on semgrep/opengrep as well as built-in regular expressions. Semgrep scans can be started from the tool directly using all available (or custom) rulesets. Results are automatically imported into SAH. Furthermore, SAH includes pre-defined regex rulesets for multiple languages and frameworks – but can also easily be extended with custom rulesets for specific project requirements.
For documentation of findings (either identified by code scanning or manual analysis), SAH allows commenting, bookmarking, prioritization and exporting/importing of findings. The documentation features are intended to enable a more streamlined process during code reviews, as analysts do not have to switch between different tools for performing the analysis and documentation of results. Finally, the state of a project can be exported for collaboration, e.g. to share the current state of a project with your team members.
Overall, the functionality of SAH integrates perfectly with the power of VS Code as an IDE – which is essential for efficient navigation in large code bases. It also integrates nicely with other plugins such as linting and programming language specific extensions. SAH is fully open-source and does not require an internet connection or user account.

SAH is intended to be used by developers and security professionals alike, who seek to identify software vulnerabilities in source code and follow-up on them in a structured manner. More specifically, we use SAH during code reviews for our clients, but also during penetration tests on web applications, APIs, desktop applications and the like whenever we get access to source code.

<details><summary><strong>Surfactant - Modular Framework for File Information Extraction and SBOM Generation</strong></summary>

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Surfactant is a modular framework for extracting information from filesystems, to help security analysts understand what's on a system and generating an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials). The information extracted is then used to help identify the various vendors or libraries associated with a file, and establish relationships between files. The resulting SBOM can be used for system level impact analysis (such as for IoT, Smart Grid, or ICS devices) of vulnerabilities, and the information gathered can be used to help inform what files to focus on for manual analysis by giving a better idea of how different software components relate to one another.
Several major new features will be demonstrated, including a terminal UI that makes Surfactant more accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise, support for decompressing several common types of archives (e.g. zip and tar), and the ability to output an interactive visualization of the gathered data that shows relationships between software components. In addition, the ability to leverage the datasets released by the DAPper project to identify what package a given file belongs to in the absence of a package manager will be demonstrated.
