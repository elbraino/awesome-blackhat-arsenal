  "Description": "Peirates is a penetration testing tool for Kubernetes, focused on privilege escalation and lateral movement. It has an interactive interface, wherein the penetration tester chooses actions from the techniques that Peirates encodes. Some of the techniques in Peirates will give you administrative access to the cluster in one-shot. Others are intended to get you tokens for an increasing number of service accounts that you can use to move laterally, steal secrets, and chain together to achieve the goals of your penetration test.",
