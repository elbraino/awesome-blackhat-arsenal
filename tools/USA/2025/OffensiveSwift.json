  "Description": "Red teamers often rely on command-line tools for macOS testing, making them highly detectable by endpoint security solutions. OffensiveSwift is a modern offensive framework built entirely in Swift, offering a native approach to macOS adversary emulation. It leverages Swift's direct access to macOS APIs\u2014without invoking traditional shell commands\u2014to minimize observable traces and lower its detection footprint.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Standalone Binary: Compiles directly into a standalone binary with no external dependencies.\n- Reduced Detections: Uses macOS APIs for a more stealthy and efficient operation.\n- Flexible TTP Chaining: Provides programmatic interfaces that seamlessly chain TTPs into complex adversary simulations.\n- Modular Design: Supports both individual technique testing and the creation of full emulation campaigns.",
