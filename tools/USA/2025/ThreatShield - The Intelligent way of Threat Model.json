  "Description": "ThreatShield is an AI-powered threat modeling and security analysis tool designed to automate and enhance threat modeling using OpenAI's enterprise API. It ingests raw security-relevant documents (such as PRDs, Confluence docs, architecture diagrams, meeting transcripts, and source code) and generates detailed STRIDE-based threat models. The output includes explicit threats, attack vectors, risk assessments, severity levels, and security recommendations, including a section for higher management in layman's terms.",
