  "Description": "BUDA is an experimental framework designed to enhance deception operations by adding realistic traces of human to deception activities. It automates the simulation of realistic user behaviors within decoy environments. BUDA recreates normal activity patterns in your environment, enhancing deception strategies through the generation of automated and realistic digital footprints. It also enables consistency in the generation of cyber deception operations by automating the process of generating and executing deception tasks.\nIt achieves this through the integration of strategic narratives, dynamic user profiles, and automated activity simulation. BUDA can also leverage real-env data for context and integrate Language Models (LLMs) for assisted generation of profiles and activities.",
