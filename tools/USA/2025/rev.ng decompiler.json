  "Description": "rev.ng is a static binary analysis framework based on LLVM and QEMU.\n\nKey features:\n\n* Full-fledged decompiler, that emits syntactically valid C.\n* Large architecture support (x86-64 x86, ARM, AArch64, MIPS and s390x).\n* Ideal environment for deobufscation thanks to the off-the-shelf availability of the LLVM -O2 optimization pipeline.\n* Support for static code analysis using symbolic execution (KLEE or clang-static-analyzer) or CodeQL.\n* Automatic recovery of data structures exploiting information across the whole program.\n* Scripting interface for Python and TypeScript.",
