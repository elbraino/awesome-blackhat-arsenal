  "Description": "**Abstract:**\n\nQ-TIP \u2013 QR Threat Inspection Protocol is an innovative, multi-layered cybersecurity tool designed to combat the emerging threat of QR code-based phishing attacks. By combining robust QR code decoding, comprehensive static URL analysis (including redirection chain tracking, WHOIS lookups, and SSL certificate validation), and advanced visual forensics using OpenCV, Q-TIP offers a granular, data-driven assessment of phishing risks. Additionally, the tool integrates threat intelligence from a continuously updated phishing artifacts database and implements suspicious file detection by securely downloading and analyzing files with malicious extensions. Its modular, scalable design supports both single-image and batch processing, generating detailed forensic reports in TXT and HTML formats that explicitly enumerate the reasons behind each phishing verdict.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Q-TIP leverages multiple layers of analysis to assess QR code threats with high accuracy.\n- **Robust Reporting:** Detailed, actionable reports provide clear insights into the factors contributing to a phishing verdict.\n- **Scalable & Modular:** Designed for both enterprise and research applications, with support for real-time and batch processing.\n- **Future-Ready:** The platform is built to evolve with integrated real-time threat intelligence, machine learning enhancements, and dynamic file forensics to safeguard millions against phishing attacks.\n\nThis abstract encapsulates Q-TIP's promise to revolutionize QR code phishing detection through technical rigor, innovative methodologies, and forward-thinking design\u2014making it a compelling solution for Black Hat USA Arsenal 2025.",
