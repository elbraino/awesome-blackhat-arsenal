  "Description": "The Tengu Marauder, derived from a previous security drone project, is a portable wheeled robot equipped with an ESP32 Marauder, currently in its testing phase. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, the Tengu Marauder serves as an alternative and interactive tool for WiFi network security testing. Its capabilities include WiFi scanning, deauthentication attacks, packet sniffing, and other wireless security tests. The compact design ensures ease of construction and maintenance using readily available parts and straightforward code integration. Essentially an advanced RC robot, the Tengu Marauder operates headless via XBee, providing a fun and engaging platform for testing the security of network-controlled devices over WiFi, such as IoT smart home devices and smaller WiFi-controlled drones like the Ryze Tello. This project would not have been possible without the support of local Philadelphia security organizations and the overall security community.",
