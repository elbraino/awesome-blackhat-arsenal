  "Description": "Traditional Command and Control (C2) frameworks frequently encounter obstacles in avoiding detection, maintaining persistence, and ensuring resilience against modern security measures. This research introduces Covert C2, an advanced Covert Command and Control (C3) system engineered to enhance operational security while minimizing detection risks through widely used persistence strategies. Covert C2 employs a decentralized infrastructure, enabling compromised machines to autonomously establish communication with the C2 server, thereby ensuring sustained covert operations. Its adaptable design supports various post-exploitation and lateral movement methods, optimizing functionality across different environments. By utilizing the Native Messaging API alongside lightweight evasion techniques, Covert C2 agents demonstrate an exceptionally zero detection rate against top-tier Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. A proof-of-concept implementation confirms Covert C2's effectiveness in real-world adversarial scenarios, particularly in executing code for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Our assessment underscores that merging decentralized communication with innovative evasion methods significantly boosts stealth, efficiency, and operational resilience. Furthermore, this study explores Covert C2's post-exploitation capabilities, assesses defensive strategies, and provides practical recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity defenses.",
