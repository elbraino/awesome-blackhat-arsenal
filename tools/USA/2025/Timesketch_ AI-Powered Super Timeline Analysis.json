  "Description": "Timesketch is a leading free open-source software (licensed under Apache-2.0) for collaborative forensic-timeline analysis, with more than 2.6k stars on GitHub. In this arsenal, we announce and showcase Timesketch AI extension designed to drastically speedup (human) analysts, identify compromise root cause analysis and improve incident reaction time.\n\nThe complexity and volume of security data to process in an incident can be overwhelming to analysts. This onslaught of data often leads to investigations with increased risk of errors, delayed effective response to threats, and hindrance of effective remediation.\n\nWith this new AI extension, Timesketch is pioneering a new investigation approach, leveraging the latest advancements in reinforcement learning, thinking, and tool use to automatically extract facts and conclusions from vast amounts of unstructured logs. Timesketch reports the AI results respecting the investigation mindset, creating an investigation plan and helping with consistent investigations.\n\nThis new Timesketch release goes beyond its novel AI algorithm, it also fundamentally reimagines the UX to optimize for AI and responders collaboration. In particular the new UI view centers the analysis on a series of investigative questions and AI insights. This new workflow empowers analysts to quickly refine and verify the facts highlighted by the AI analysis.\n\nLast but not least, the new Timesketch's API is vendor agnostic and allows practitioners to use any model providers of their choosing.\n\nThe demo will showcase how AI driven investigations in Timesketch:\n- Autonomously analyzes timelines, creates and answers investigative questions, identifies key events and patterns, and finds the root (or common) cause of various compromise types.\n- Provides interactive review, empowering analysts to seamlessly verify, edit, and refine AI-generated findings, ensuring accuracy through clear links to supporting facts and emphasizing the crucial role of human validation.\n- Facilitates collaborative timeline analysis by integrating with Timesketch's collaborative environment, where analysts work together on AI-powered investigations.",
