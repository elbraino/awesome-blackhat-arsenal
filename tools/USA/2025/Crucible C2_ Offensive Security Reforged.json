  "Description": "Crucible is an extensible, multi-user, cross-platform framework designed for post-exploitation, command and control operations, penetration testing, and red teaming.\n\nIt consists of a per-operator client application, a shared teamserver, and supports language-agnostic implants and plugins.\n\nWith this release of Crucible, modern extensibility is achieved through in-memory .NET plugins or gRPC-based plugins, enabling remote communication with external applications regardless of language, allowing extensibility that fits both the operator's skill set and needs.",
