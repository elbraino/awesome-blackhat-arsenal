  "Description": "In the fields of cybersecurity and reverse engineering, traditional integrations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with tools like IDA Pro have faced significant challenges. Existing solutions not only heavily depend on manual intervention\u2014requiring time-consuming, function-by-function analysis via the IDA Pro GUI\u2014but also fail to effectively combine static and dynamic analysis. By exclusively focusing on static analysis, these methods risk overlooking crucial insights that dynamic analysis could reveal, resulting in a limited and fragmented approach.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative framework centered around an MCP Server, serving as a unified interface. This approach transforms the LLM into a fully autonomous intelligent agent capable of managing a complete binary analysis workflow while drastically reducing human effort. Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates both static and dynamic analysis tools into a collaborative pipeline, ensuring a comprehensive examination of binary files. Additionally, utilizing the MCP Server enhances code reusability and scalability, aligning the process more closely with professional reverse engineering practices.\n\nKey Points:\n- Automation: Delegates the entire analysis process to the LLM with minimal human intervention.\n- Comprehensive Analysis: Combines static and dynamic analysis to uncover deeper insights.\n- Tool Reusability: Leverages a unified MCP Server interface to improve portability and scalability.\n\nThis paradigm shift in tool integration not only addresses the inherent shortcomings of traditional methods but also paves the way for a more efficient and thorough binary analysis system.",
