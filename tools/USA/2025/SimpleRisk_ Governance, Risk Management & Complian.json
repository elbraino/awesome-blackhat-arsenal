  "Description": "Security professionals make risk-based decisions every day\u2014whether it's assessing web application vulnerabilities, defending against malware, or securing physical assets. While risk management is conceptually simple, many practitioners struggle due to inadequate tools. Large enterprises can afford expensive GRC solutions, but most professionals are stuck wrestling with spreadsheets\u2014an inefficient, frustrating process prone to errors.\n\nFacing these same challenges while building a risk management program from scratch at a $1B/year company, Josh Sokol sought a better solution. With no budget for enterprise GRC, he built one himself.\n\nSimpleRisk is a free, open-source solution for Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC). Built on open technologies and licensed under MPL 2.0, it deploys in minutes, offering risk professionals a powerful yet flexible platform to manage control frameworks, policies, audits, and risk mitigation strategies. With dynamic reporting, configurable risk formulas, and continuous development, SimpleRisk delivers enterprise-grade risk management without enterprise-grade costs.\n\nSimpleRisk: making risk management simple.",
