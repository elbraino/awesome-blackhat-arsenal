  "Description": "Dvora is an open-source Python tool that enhances SAST detection by identifying custom implementations of dangerous functions (e.g., strcpy) in compiled ELF binaries. It uses a Unicorn-based emulation engine to run individual functions across multiple architectures and a rule set that maps function behavior to well-known function names, then adds discovered symbols to the ELF's symbol section to improve subsequent SAST analysis.",
