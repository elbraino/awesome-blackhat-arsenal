  "Description": "Sigma rules are critical for threat detection, but creating effective rules often involves manual, time-consuming processes and requires a deep understanding of threats. Recently, LLM-based Sigma rule creation from threat report is a hot topic in cybersecurity, offering automation benefits but facing key challenges:\n\nAccuracy and Reliability\n- Without real-world log analysis, LLM-generated rules risk hallucination and may not accurately reflect malicious behavior, making them unreliable.\n\nDetection Delay\n- Threat reports are typically published some time after an attack occurs, resulting in a delay in detection. This time lag increases the risk of incidents occurring before adequate detection measures can be established.\n\nSigmaOptimizer is a revolutionary tool that automates the entire workflow of Sigma rule generation, validation, and optimization by leveraging real-world logs and LLM. This Arsenal session introduces SigmaOptimizer, highlighting its capabilities in automatically generating robust Sigma rules from actual log data, validating syntax, testing detection effectiveness, and checking false positives. The tool further strengthens detection by supporting command obfuscation, ensuring rules remain resilient against evasion techniques.\n\nSigmaOptimizer also seamlessly integrates with MITRE Caldera, enabling users to effortlessly experiment with various attack techniques. This integration empowers users to quickly generate realistic attack logs and automatically produce corresponding Sigma rules, enhancing threat coverage and reducing manual effort.\n\nParticipants will gain insights into effectively automating threat detection processes, significantly enhancing their Threat Hunting, SOC operations, and forensic investigations. Live demonstrations will showcase automated rule generation, obfuscation handling, MITRE Caldera integration, and practical evaluation using SigmaOptimizer's integrated validation framework.",
