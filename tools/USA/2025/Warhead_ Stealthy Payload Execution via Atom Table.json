  "Description": "Warhead is an offensive security tool that leverages Windows Atom Tables to store, retrieve, and execute payloads in a stealthy manner. This technique enables adversaries to place a payload in the Atom Table, use a legitimate process to extract it, and execute it in memory—bypassing traditional detection mechanisms. The first version of Warhead, to be released at Black Hat Arsenal 2025, provides security researchers and red teamers with a novel approach to payload delivery and execution that evades modern security defenses.",
