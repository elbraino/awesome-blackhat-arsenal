  "Description": "DNSForge is a network penetration testing tool that introduces a novel tactic to intercept and manipulate name resolution requests made to the authoritative DNS server in an internal network environment. DNSForge achieves interception and reuse of Windows user credentials without any user interaction. While existing poisoning attacks target fallback protocols (such as LLMNR and NBT-NS) or DNS over IPv6, DNSForge employs manipulations on layer 2 to target the primary DNS protocol over IPv4. This enables the tool to bypass current mitigations against existing poisoning attacks as it imitates a legitimate response to name resolutions requests over DNS. Hence, the non-interactive, vulnerable-by-design and seemingly legitimate elements of this attack ensure higher success rates as compared to traditional poisoning attacks.",
