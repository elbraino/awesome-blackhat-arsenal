  "Description": "MissionEvasion is a proof-of-concept tool designed to demonstrate advanced process injection techniques that adapt to evolving Windows security mechanisms. Initially built on Process Hollowing, MissionEvasion now incorporates a modern Process Overwriting technique to bypass new mitigations introduced in Windows 11 24H2, particularly restrictions on executing payloads from MEM_PRIVATE regions. The tool walks through each step of the injection chain\u2014mapping, section writing, relocation patching, and process restoration\u2014with clear source code for red team research, education, and experimentation.",
