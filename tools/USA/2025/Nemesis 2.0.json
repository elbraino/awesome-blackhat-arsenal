  "Description": "Nemesis 2.0 is a ground-up rewrite of the Nemesis offensive data enrichment pipeline. We took two years of lessons learned and rebuilt Nemesis with a focus on extensibility, stability, and massively improved usability. We've narrowed the focus for Nemesis to its most used functionality: facilitating manual file triage for offensive operations. While platforms like VirusTotal revolutionized defensive file analysis, the offensive community lacks a centralized, scalable solution tailored to red team operations - exactly what Nemesis aims to be.",
