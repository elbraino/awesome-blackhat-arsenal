  "Description": "Logstory is an open-source Python tool that replays security telemetry in various standard formats from numerous vendors. Its primary function is to update timestamps from the various and diverse security log formats, while preserving the temporal relationships between the events. This allows for accurate and repeatable demonstration and testing of security detections and response workflows. The project includes scenarios that have been used internally at Google to exercise Google SecOps. Those scenarios are now published in a cloud storage bucket, so they may be downloaded and replayed with the Logstory utility to any SIEM.",
