  "Description": "This is a comprehensive security scanning tool for Kubernetes clusters that identifies security issues, misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities. I built this tool while i was studying for CKS and i have found it really useful for real world workloads. It has the following features.\n\n1 . Cluster Setup and Hardening\nLocks down the foundation: CIS‑aligned configs, safe admission plugs, tight RBAC, and restrictive network policies.\n\nCIS Benchmark Checker – drift & remediation\n\nAdmission Controller Checker – PSP/PSA, webhooks\n\nRBAC Checker – wild‑card verbs, risky bindings\n\nNetwork Policy Checker – open namespaces, default‑allow rules\n\n2 . System Hardening\nFortifies nodes and runtimes—kernel params, kubelet flags, containerd/Docker, and gVisor isolation.\n\nNode Security Checker – OS & kubelet hygiene\n\nRuntime Security Checker – seccomp, AppArmor, privilege creep\n\ngVisor Checker – runtime‑class wiring, sandbox health\n\n3 . Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities\nApplies least‑privilege to pods: security contexts, resource limits, PDBs, and secrets hygiene.\n\nContainer Security Checker – capabilities, limits, image trust\n\nPod Security Checker – priority/QoS, disruption budgets\n\nSecrets Management Checker – encryption, rotation, exposure\n\n4 . Supply Chain Security\nAdmits only trusted code via image signatures, SBOM validation, and CVE detection.\n\nImage Security Checker – signatures, vuln scan, registry posture\n\nSBOM Checker – dependency CVEs, license red flags\n\n5 . Runtime Security\nMaintains live visibility with audit pipelines and Falco rules for instant threat detection.\n\nAudit Checker – policy coverage, backend integrity\n\nFalco Checker – rule quality, alert wiring, violation monitoring",
