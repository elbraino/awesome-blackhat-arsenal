  "Tool Name": "ASRepCatcher",
  "Description": "ASRepCatcher is an Active Directory attack tool that makes everyone in your VLAN ASRep-roastable. It uses ARP spoofing to eavesdrop on Kerberos authentication traffic, forces RC4 encryption downgrades by manipulating the negotiation process, and captures crackable AS-REP messages. Supports both relay and listen modes for flexible network-based credential harvesting in AD environments.",
