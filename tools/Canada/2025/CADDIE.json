  "Description": "CADDIE is an AI-powered compliance tool built to help organizations automate regulatory gap analysis, policy generation, and secure AI deployment. Designed by cybersecurity veteran Brennan Lodge (HSBC, Goldman Sachs), CADDIE leverages a fine-tuned BERT model and a proprietary Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows that are explainable, secure, and adaptable across industries. Unlike traditional GRC platforms, CADDIE supports offline and air-gapped deployments, offers token-based consumption pricing, and allows integration with proprietary regulatory and policy corpora.",
