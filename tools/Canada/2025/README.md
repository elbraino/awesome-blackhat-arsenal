🔗 **Link:** [Spikee](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/spikee)  
📝 **Description:** Spikee (https://spikee.ai) is an open-source tool we developed from two years of security assessments of LLM applications and GenAI use cases, focusing on practical cyber security risks. These risks stem from the interaction between LLMs and the applications that rely on them, leading to exploitable outcomes such as data exfiltration, XSS, and resource exhaustion—rather than generating harmful content, as seen in typical "LLM red teaming". Unlike academic approaches that can be impractical in the field and often give difficult to interpret, generic results, Spikee gives pentesters the tools to actually test LLM apps with customizable datasets and attacks that match a specific application's constraints and use-cases. Built from our hands-on experience, Spikee addresses prompt injection risks across the entire LLM application pipeline, featuring evasion plugins and dynamic attacks specifically designed to bypass model alignment and state-of-the-art prompt injection filters.

📝 **Description:** CTFs and Attack-Defense competitions are very popular in cybersecurity and help security practitioners sharpen their skills. However, most of the challenges that you encounter reinforce offensive security knowledge. This type of learning does not match the skills of many blue teamers and other professionals requiring defensive expertise: software developers, testers, architects, and IT specialists. To fill the need for defensive training, we are releasing Siege - a competition software we have successfully used in national cybersecurity games in Canada. The Siege contest environment consists of a scoreboard server and a set of player environments, each containing an attack bot and a set of vulnerable services. Each team must defend their services and fix vulnerabilities that they find while maintaining uptime and preserving original functionality. Varying request patterns, encrypted protocols, and hard-to-spot logic errors make this a challenging contest while emphasizing the testing of players' defensive knowledge. We will describe the competition environment architecture, demo its functionality and discuss do's and don't of developing defence challenges.
