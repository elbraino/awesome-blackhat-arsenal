  "Tool Name": "Azazel System",
  "Description": "Azazel System is a portable active cyber defense tool that uses decoy-based delaying tactics to mislead and restrain attackers. Deployable on a Raspberry Pi, it boots a full SOC/NOC stack with Suricata IDS/IPS, OpenCanary decoys, Vector log pipeline, and Mattermost alerts. Unlike traditional honeypots that passively observe, Azazel actively absorbs, controls, and delays attacks, providing defenders with critical response time in untrusted networks.",
