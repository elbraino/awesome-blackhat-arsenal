📝 **Description:** Defenders and attackers often simplify vulnerabilities into '0-day' or '1-day' categories, neglecting the nuanced gray areas where attackers thrive. In this session, we'll explore critical flaws we've uncovered in the open-source vulnerability disclosure process and introduce our tool to detect open-source projects that are at risk from these flaws. We'll reveal how vulnerabilities can be exploited prior to receiving patches and official announcements, posing significant risks for users. Our comprehensive analysis of GitHub (including issues, pull requests, and commit messages) and NVD metadata will illuminate vulnerabilities that don't neatly fit into the conventional '0-day' or '1-day' classifications but instead fall into 'Half-Day' or '0.75-Day' periods – moments when vulnerabilities are known but not yet fully disclosed or patched. Furthermore, we'll spotlight the techniques employed to identify these vulnerabilities, showcasing various scenarios and vulnerabilities discovered through this method. During this session, we'll introduce an open-source tool designed to detect such vulnerabilities and emphasize the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit this information and develop exploits. Our objective is to aid practitioners in identifying and mitigating issues throughout their vulnerability disclosure lifecycle.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) is an open-source dependency management and security tool that looks across all first-party, third-party, and open-source software, aggregating the software security metadata into a high-fidelity graph database to locate, store, analyze, and correlate software artifact data.

The frequency of software attacks and increased use of open-source tooling have created a significant lack of confidence in the integrity and security of the software supply chain. Securing it can be a real headache when dealing with hundreds of pieces of software each with its own hundreds of dependencies and new vulnerabilities being discovered each day. GUAC responds by being the source of truth. GUAC can provide developers and security teams with a shared understanding of software knowledge gaps, compliance, and threat detection. It also is an effective tool for managing third-party risk and incident response.

With GUAC, users can establish connections and compliance in their software catalog, unveil gaps in software supply chain data, and enable threat detection and response. The tool ingests and analyzes software supply chain metadata from a myriad of internal and external sources and multiple common metadata document types, including:

- Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats and transforming them into data nodes and relationships,
providing insights into software and dependencies
- Ingesting and transforming SLSA and in-toto attestations into their constituent facts, offering crucial information about the provenance
and integrity of software components
- Being flexible and extensible to ingest data from local file systems, AWS S3, Google Cloud, OCI registries, and external package
repositories
- Embracing additional metadata and threat information from sources like the deps.dev and OSV APIs

GUAC provides seamless visibility across an organization's software ecosystem, easily integrating with existing tools.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Veip_Gen is a scriptable, command-line based tool for generating vulnerable programs to support teaching and learning buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The capability uses well-known vulnerable functions with a configurable amount of stack space and buffer sizes to create unique, vulnerable programs as examples for exploitation.

The capability allows you to specify vulnerable functions such as strcpy, sprintf, gets, and more. In addition, the configurable stack size and buffer size introduces different amounts of stack space that needs to be overflowed to teach, or learn, about the conditions that make buffer overflows exploitable. In addition, there are currently two major types of exploitable programs that can be produced: vanilla and conditional. The vanilla buffer overflows are what you see when first learning to overwrite the EIP register and gain execution from the stack. This type is still configurable with stack and buffer sizes as well. Second, the conditional type lets you configure a condition that must be satisfied before being able to exploit the example, vulnerable program. Either, there must be a certain number of arguments present or there must be a series of bytes that must be matched in order to trigger the vulnerable code path.

Reducing the barrier to entry and education for complex, cyber security topics will increase the readiness and capability of the cyber security workforce writ large and this tool will help those both teaching and learning to better understand the buffer overflow exploits with an unlimited number of examples that can be created simply from the command-line.

🔗 **Link:** [CODASM: Hiding Payloads in Plain .text](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/codasm)  
📝 **Description:** Sometimes we just can't afford the luxury of staging our C2 payloads but need to bring them along as part of the initial payload we deliver. This can become quite the challenge as modern AVs and EDRs feature some pretty sophisticated static and dynamic analysis strategies. One strategy, detection of high file entropy, proved to be an unexpected but annoying challenge we needed to overcome during an assessment. The specific EDR we faced just wouldn't let our binaries pass - so we went to find a solution.
This tool implements an approach to decrease a payload's entropy while increasing its size.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Silver SAML Forger is a tool developed to PoC SAML response forging, also known as Silver SAML and Golden SAML attacks, against applications federated to Entra ID for authentication using the SAML standard. The tool goes along with research into the vulnerabilities that can present in cloud identity providers, such as Entra ID, where if an attacker has access to the private key material Entra ID uses for SAML response signing, that the target applications may be susceptible to these forging attacks.

While Entra ID protects the private key if generated internally, as it cannot be exported, in the real-world organizations follow bad habits that may leave sensitive private key material available to an attacker. These sorts of habits have been observed by the research team that developed the Silver SAML Forger. Using this tool in combination with tools such as Burp Suite, you can demonstrate forging access to a target application. If the application supports certain types of SAML integrations, the identity provider will have no visibility into the authentication – you could think of these attacks as Kerberos Golden-ticket type attacks.

The tool requires the signing certificate to use, the username that is target for impersonation, and some basic federation information about the target application that can be derived from a few different methods.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Are you looking for an advanced tool that can help you detect and prevent sophisticated exploits on your systems? Look no further than eBPFShield. Let's take a technical look at some of the capabilities of this powerful technology:

DNS monitoring feature is particularly useful for detecting DNS tunneling, a technique used by attackers to bypass network security measures. By monitoring DNS queries, eBPFShield can help detect and block these attempts before any damage is done.

IP-Intelligence feature allows you to monitor outbound connections and check them against threat intelligence lists. This helps prevent command-and-control (C2) communications, a common tactic used by attackers to control compromised systems. By blocking outbound connections to known C2 destinations, eBPFShield can prevent attackers from exfiltrating sensitive data or delivering additional payloads to your system.

eBPFShield Machine Learning feature, you can develop and run advanced machine learning algorithms entirely in eBPF. We demonstrate a flow-based network intrusion detection system(IDS) based on machine learning entirely in eBPF. Our solution uses a decision tree and decides for each packet whether it is malicious or not, considering the entire previous context of the network flow.

eBPFShield Forensics helps address Linux security issues by analyzing system calls and kernel events to detect possible code injection into another process. It can also help identify malicious files and processes that may have been introduced to your system, allowing you to remediate any security issues quickly and effectively.

During the session, we'll delve deeper into these features and demonstrate how eBPFShield can help you protect your systems against even the most advanced threats.

📝 **Description:** Surfactant is a modular framework for extracting information from filesystems, primarily for generating an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials). The information extracted can then be used to identify the various vendors or libraries associated with a file, and establish relationships between files. The resulting SBOM can be used for system level impact analysis (such as for IoT, Smart Grid, or ICS devices) of vulnerabilities, and the information gathered can be used to help inform what files to focus on for manual analysis.

Several recently added features will be demonstrated, including functionality for helping visualize the contents of a file system and the relationships between files. The initial results from integrating new methods to identify the package that files (compiled binaries or scripts) belong to will also be discussed.
