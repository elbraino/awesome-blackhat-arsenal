  "Description": "Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) is an open-source dependency management and security tool that looks across all first-party, third-party, and open-source software, aggregating the software security metadata into a high-fidelity graph database to locate, store, analyze, and correlate software artifact data.\n\nThe frequency of software attacks and increased use of open-source tooling have created a significant lack of confidence in the integrity and security of the software supply chain. Securing it can be a real headache when dealing with hundreds of pieces of software each with its own hundreds of dependencies and new vulnerabilities being discovered each day. GUAC responds by being the source of truth. GUAC can provide developers and security teams with a shared understanding of software knowledge gaps, compliance, and threat detection. It also is an effective tool for managing third-party risk and incident response.\n\nWith GUAC, users can establish connections and compliance in their software catalog, unveil gaps in software supply chain data, and enable threat detection and response. The tool ingests and analyzes software supply chain metadata from a myriad of internal and external sources and multiple common metadata document types, including:\n\n- Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats and transforming them into data nodes and relationships,\nproviding insights into software and dependencies\n- Ingesting and transforming SLSA and in-toto attestations into their constituent facts, offering crucial information about the provenance\nand integrity of software components\n- Being flexible and extensible to ingest data from local file systems, AWS S3, Google Cloud, OCI registries, and external package\nrepositories\n- Embracing additional metadata and threat information from sources like the deps.dev and OSV APIs\n\nGUAC provides seamless visibility across an organization's software ecosystem, easily integrating with existing tools.",
