  "Description": "Surfactant is a modular framework for extracting information from filesystems, primarily for generating an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials). The information extracted can then be used to identify the various vendors or libraries associated with a file, and establish relationships between files. The resulting SBOM can be used for system level impact analysis (such as for IoT, Smart Grid, or ICS devices) of vulnerabilities, and the information gathered can be used to help inform what files to focus on for manual analysis.\n\nSeveral recently added features will be demonstrated, including functionality for helping visualize the contents of a file system and the relationships between files. The initial results from integrating new methods to identify the package that files (compiled binaries or scripts) belong to will also be discussed.",
