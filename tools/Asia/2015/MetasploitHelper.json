  "Description": "Metasploit is widely used by penetration-testers during pen-test. They contain a lot of useful exploits that can be used during penetration tests. However, it is a painful task to search for related exploits after running a Nmap scan. It is possible that we could forget to use a potential exploit that could get us a shell on the remote system. There are two main types of exploits in Metasploit that we need to consider: Metasploit modules that target URI and modules that target specific ports. I developed MetasploitHelper so that we can bridge Nmap and Metasploit modules. This tool is meant to save a lot of time looking up exploits during penetration tests.",
