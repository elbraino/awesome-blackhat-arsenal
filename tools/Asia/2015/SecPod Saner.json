The anti-malware products that are available in the market focus on cleaning an already infected system based on known malware signatures. It is reported that 67% of malware is unnoticed by anti-virus or anti-malware products because of their polymorphic nature.Hardening the security posture of the system, knowing the loopholes, and applying fixes is a very effective and proven defense system. Although prevalent in the enterprise segment, home and mobile users do not get the benefit of effective vulnerability and configuration management.SecPod Saner is a lightweight, easy to use, enterprise-grade security solution for proactively assessing and securing your personal computer.
