  "Description": "CapTipper is a python tool to analyze, explore, and revive HTTP malicious traffic. CapTipper sets up a web server that acts exactly as the server in the PCAP file and contains internal tools, with a powerful interactive console, for analysis and inspection of the hosts, objects, and conversations found.The tool provides the security researcher with easy access to the files and the understanding of the network flow, and is useful when trying to research exploits, pre-conditions, versions, obfuscations, plugins, and shellcodes.Feeding CapTipper with a drive-by traffic capture (e.g. of an exploit kit) displays the user with the REQUEST_URI's that were sent and metadata responses. The user can at this point browse to http://127.0.0.1/[URI] and receive the response back to the browser. In addition, an interactive shell is launched for deeper investigation using various commands such as hosts, hexdump, info, ungzip, body, client, dump, and more.",
