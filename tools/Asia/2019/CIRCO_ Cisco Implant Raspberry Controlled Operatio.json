  "Description": "Designed under Raspberry Pi Zero and aimed for cover red-team Ops, we take advantage of SecNetDevOps tools to capture network credentials in a stealth mode.\n\nThe tool uses a low profile hardware/electronics and different methods for credentials exfiltration. It also uses a combination of honeypots and information gather to lure Automation Systems into reveling network credentials (ssh/telnet/snmp) to our implant.",
