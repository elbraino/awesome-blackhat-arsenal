  "Description": "To perform malicious actions, attackers create malware; however, they cannot achieve their goals unless their attempts remain undetected. There is a cat and-mouse game between defenders and attackers, which includes attackers monitoring the operations of security technologies and practices.\n\nThe Unprotect Project is an open-source project that aims to propose a complete classification about Evasion Techniques to help to understand and analyze a malware. This project is dedicated to Windows PE malware but will be extended to other platforms in the future.\n\nPresentation Slides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1koZ5emW2vu9o3gvWdaWZx_mz90bD3rSH/view",
