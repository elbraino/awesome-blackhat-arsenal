  "Description": "VxWorks is the industry's leading real-time operating system. It has been widely used in various industry scenarios, which require real-time, deterministic performance and, in many cases, safety and security certifications such as the NASA's Insight Spacecraft. There was lot's of research on Linux based Router and camera, rarely seen research of VxWorks based device.\n\nMost of VxWorks based IoT devices on the market didn't contain any built-in debugger like WDB(VxWorks WDB Debug Agent) or command line debugger. Without debugger it's almost impossible to analyze the root cause of vulnerability or exploit vulnerabilities.\n\nVxHunter contains an firmware analyze tool and an serial debugger tool. The firmware analysis tool is an IDA plugin which can automatically analyze and rebase firmware to correct loading address, fix function name from symbol table, etc. The serial debugger tool is designed for the target which didn't have built-in debugger like WDB. With VxHunter's help, we successfully analyzed and exploited the CVE-2018-19528 vulnerability.",
