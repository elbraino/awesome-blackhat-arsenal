  "Description": "In GyioThon released at Black Hat Asia 2018 Arsenal, we used Deep Learning to enable us to identify products that traditional penetration test tools could not identify. In the original GyoiThon, as well as in other tools, it has always been necessary for someone to investigate product-specific features and signature generation with continuous updates, which we've been working to update to make easier. GyoiThon is the growing penetration test tool using Deep Learning. Deep Learning improves classification accuracy in proportion to the amount of learning data. Therefore GyoiThon will be taking in new learning data every scanning. Since GyoiThon uses various features of software included in HTTP response as learning data, you scan more, the accuracy of software detection improves. For this reason, GyoiThon is the growing penetration test tool.\n\nGyoiThon identifies the software installed on web server (OS, Middleware, Framework, CMS, etc...) based on the learning data. After that, GyoiThon executes valid exploits for the identified software. GyoiThon automatically generates reports of scan results. GyoiThon executes the above processing fully automatically.\n\nGyoiThon's major updates:\n- Automatically generates the signature to identify various products.\n- Can generate signatures necessary for product identification by even users without Deep Learning knowledge using Deep Learning. You no longer have to investigate product-specific features. You no longer need to create a signature, because GyoiThon itself can generate signatures fully automatically.\n\nGyoiThon is the first penetration test tool that made it possible to generate signatures automatically. GyoiThon is evolving as the growing penetration test tool.
