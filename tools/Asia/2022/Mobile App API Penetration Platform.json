  "Description": "There are many protections being applied to mobile applications nowadays, and most penetration testing engineer use primitive methods to crack them. Therefore, if we can modify the data or insert the payload of the vulnerability before the protection is processed, all the protections will be transparent to the penetration testers and there will be no concern about their implementation, making app API testing purer.",
