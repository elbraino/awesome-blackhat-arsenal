  "Description": "HaboMalHunter is an automated malware analysis tool for Linux ELF files, which is a sub-project of Habo Analysis System independently developed by Tencent Antivirus Laboratory. It can comprehensively analyze samples from both static information and dynamic behaviors, trigger and capture behaviors of the samples in the sandbox and output the results in various formats. The generated report reveals significant information about process, file I/O , network and system calls.Recently, HaboMalHunter has opened its source code under the MIT license, aimed to share and discuss the automatic analysis technology with researchers alike. The project applies digital forensics techniques, such as kernel space system call tracing and memory analysis, and it emphasizes the importance of collaboration with mainstream security tools by making it easy to add third-party YARA rules and supporting the output of .mdb files that are hash-based signature of the ClamAV. The tool, by generating a .syscall file containing a system call number sequence, is also friendly to artificial intelligence research on malware classification and detection.HaboMalHunter has also been deployed and validated with a large-scale cluster at Tencent Antivirus Laboratory. With the processing ability of thousands of ELF malware samples per day, most of which are from the VirusTotal, HaboMalHunter helps security analysts extract static and dynamic features effectively and efficiently. We hope to present the technical architecture and the detailed implementation about HaboMalHunter and to demonstrate it with several typical real-world Linux malware samples.DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/Tencent/HaboMalHunter",
