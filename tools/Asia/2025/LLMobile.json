  "Tool Name": "LLMobile",
  "Description": "In the era of digital transformation, mobile applications have become integral to the way businesses operate, engage with customers, and deliver services.
Mobile apps handle vast amounts of sensitive information, such as user data, payment details, and authentication tokens.
Traditional mobile security scanners primarily rely on static code analysis, searching for known vulnerability patterns or signatures. While effective to an extent, these tools often generate high false positives and may miss context-dependent vulnerabilities that don't align with predefined rules. In contrast, our tool leverages LLMs to intelligently reduce false positives, honing in on genuine security issues with greater accuracy and depth.",
