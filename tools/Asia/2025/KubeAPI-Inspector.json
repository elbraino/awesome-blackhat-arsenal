  "Tool Name": "KubeAPI-Inspector",
  "Description": "Due to the rapid development of cloud-native technologies, an increasing number of popular applications are extending Kubernetes' control plane functionalities through extension apiserver. With Kubernetes being centered around a declarative API, we have designed a tool specifically for this scenario. This tool aims to efficiently and automatically discover hidden vulnerable APIs within the cluster. Additionally, we will publish a vulnerability pattern for the first time,which occurs when the golang struct embedding and promoted methods are used improperly, and demonstrate this problem through a workshop, this problem which could potentially lead to API endpoint authentication failures, thereby jeopardizing the entire cluster.",
