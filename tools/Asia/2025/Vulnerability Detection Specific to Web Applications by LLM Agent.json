  "Tool Name": "Vulnerability Detection Specific to Web Applications by LLM Agent",
  "Description": "In recent years, research on automating penetration testing and software testing using LLMs has been actively conducted. For example, the paper \"PentestGPT: An LLM-empowered Automatic Penetration Testing Tool\" attempts to automate penetration testing primarily in the network domain and has successfully performed complete penetration testing on servers with Easy and Medium difficulty levels on Hack The Box. Additionally, the paper \"LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites\" examines whether a black-box LLM such as GPT-4 can exploit common vulnerabilities like SQL injection in actual websites. This research demonstrates that models like GPT-4 can identify vulnerabilities in real-world websites and exploit complex vulnerabilities without prior vulnerability information.",
