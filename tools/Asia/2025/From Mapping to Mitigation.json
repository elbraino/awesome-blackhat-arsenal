  "Tool Name": "From Mapping to Mitigation",
  "Description": "We'll cover the full lifecycle—from mapping using a range of discovery tools (subfinder, dnsx, etc.) and enriching with tools like httpx and katana, to scanning and triaging with Nuclei. Plus, we'll touch on integrated ticketing in nuclei, regression handling, and our community-led inventory of actionable, exploitable vulnerability checks, misconfigurations, DAST, auditing, and more.",
