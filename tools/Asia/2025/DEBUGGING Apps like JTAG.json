  "Tool Name": "DEBUGGING Apps like JTAG",
  "Description": "Simulation execution plays a vital role in computer security and boasts a wide range of applications, such as reversing obfuscated malware, fuzzing programs to identify vulnerabilities, or swiftly pinpointing the causes of program crashes. Unfortunately, the existing binary library emulators or tracing tools on the Android platform suffer from some issues: 1. Lack Runtime: For tools running on PC, this entails the manual simulation of JNI and Java methods. Examples include Unidbg, AndroidNativeEmu and Qiling; 2. Poor Stability: There are frequent direct crashes or infinite loops during simulation execution or tracing. For example, the Frida Stalker experiences such issues; 3. Low Performance: Inefficient tracing and fuzzing that can be frustrating.",
