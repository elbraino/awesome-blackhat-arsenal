  "Description": "Malware evasion consists of techniques used by malware to bypass security in place, circumvent automated and static analysis as well as avoiding detection and harden reverse engineering. There is a broad specter of techniques that can be used. In this talk we will review the history of malware evasion techniques, understand the latest trends currently used by threat actors and bolster your security analysis skills by getting more knowledge about evasion mechanisms.\n\nWe will present the latest major update of the Unprotect Project an open-source documentation about malware evasion techniques. The goal will be to present the project and see how we can leverage it for use cases, including threat intelligence, malware analysis, strengthen security, train people, and extend the Mitre ATT&CK matrix. Over the years it has become a well renowned place for security researchers. During this talk we will review some of the most important update.\n\nThis presentation can benefit both Blue and Red Team as it will provide knowledge and information on how malware can bypass your security in place and stay under the radar. You will learn about the intrinsic mechanisms used by attackers to compromise you without you even realizing it!",
