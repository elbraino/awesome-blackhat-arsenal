  "Description": "This library provides a convenient way for developers to integrate post-quantum cryptography into their applications, helping to protect sensitive information from potential quantum computing attacks. We present f5oqs_sdk, a Python 3 library that wraps the liboqs C library, which is part of the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project. The OQS project aims to develop and prototype quantum-resistant cryptography. The f5oqs_sdk offers a unified API for post-quantum key encapsulation and digital signature schemes, as well as a collection of open-source implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. It also provides support for alternative RNGs through the randombytes[] functions. The library is available on PyPI and can be easily installed with pip. The paper provides a brief overview of the installation process and usage of the library, along with examples of how to use the API.\n\nf5oqs_sdk is a powerful tool for developers who want to integrate post-quantum cryptography into their applications. It provides a unified and easy-to-use API for implementing quantum-resistant cryptography, helping to protect sensitive information from potential quantum computing attacks.",
