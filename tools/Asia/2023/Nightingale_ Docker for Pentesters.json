  "Description": "Have you ever been encounter where you configured the security virtual envieonment in the virtualbox and after someday the VM got crashed. All your configuration, tool setup, important information about the taget, POC's and what not, all will be gone and you can't recover the same.\n\nWith the same problem, I created the Nightingale based on the docker technology which provides you the exact security environment where you can expreicne the tools which a pentesters required at the time of pentesting. Adding to this, you no need to worry about your data, configuration and all other important. Nightingale will automatically restore the configuration once the new container will be up.",
