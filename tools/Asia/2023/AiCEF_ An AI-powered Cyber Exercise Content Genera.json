  "Description": "The core idea of AiCEF, is to harness the intelligence that is available from online and MISP reports, as well as threat groups' activities, arsenal etc., from, e.g., MITRE, to create relevant and timely cybersecurity exercises. To this end, we have developed a specialised ontology called Cyber Exercise Scenario Ontology (CESO), which extends STIX [2]. The core idea is to map reports; both from online resources and MISP, via a common ontology to graphs. This way, we abstract the events from the reports in a machine-readable form. The produced graphs can be infused with additional intelligence, e.g. the threat actor profile from MITRE, also mapped in our ontology. While this may fill gaps that would be missing from a report, one can also manipulate the graph to create custom and unique models. Finally, we exploit transformer-based language models like GPT to convert the graph into text that can serve as the scenario of a cybersecurity exercise.\nWe have tested and validated AiCEF with a group of experts in cybersecurity exercises, and the results clearly show that AiCEF significantly augments the capabilities in creating timely and relevant cybersecurity exercises in terms of both quality and time.",
