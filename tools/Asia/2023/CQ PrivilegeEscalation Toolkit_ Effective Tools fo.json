  "Description": "CQURE PE Toolkit is focused on Windows Privilege Escalation tactics and techniques created to help to improve every privilege escalation game. This toolkit guides you through the process of exploiting a bug or design flaw in an operating system or software to gain elevated privileges to resources that are normally highly protected. Once you know what to look for and what to ignore, Privilege Escalation will become so much easier. This powerful toolkit is tremendously useful for those who are interested in penetration testing and professionals engaged in pen-testing who work in the areas of databases, systems, networks, or application administration.",
