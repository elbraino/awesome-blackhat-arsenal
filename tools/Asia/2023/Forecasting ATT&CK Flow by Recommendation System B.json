  "Description": "Our tool is to forecast undetected ATT&CK techniques based on collaborative filtering and graph databases.\nPCs and servers are generating massive logs daily, on the other hand, SOCs analysts are required to detect and respond quickly to cyber-attacks. However, it will take a lot of time to detect cyber-attacks if SOC analysts do not have clues. Conventional log analysis tools such as SIEM can detect attacks but cannot predict the next attack from the information already obtained. Recommendation systems often used in e-commerce sites can predict future purchasing behavior by analyzing the user's purchase history. Replacing with ATT&CK, each attacker group can be considered a user, and techniques attackers use can be regarded as a user's purchase history.\nUsing this tool, the logs are mapped to ATT&CK techniques by uploading log files to create a technique usage history of the attacker (adversary) currently conducting an ongoing attack. The adversary's technique usage history and past APT attack data are used for collaborative filtering to predict which techniques the adversary may use in the future. This visualization is\u3000displayed together with the ATT&CK tactic, enabling you to see the attack flow in stages of progression. In addition, search queries of SIEM associated with forecasted ATT&CK technique are outputted. SOC analysts can consider attacks quickly and comprehensively by using queries.\nThe source code of this tool and an example analysis will be shown on GitHub. It is available as a web application.",
