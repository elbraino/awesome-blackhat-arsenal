  "Description": "Generally, when using WiFi Fuzzing Tool to test the security of WiFi protocol, you need a WiFi USB dongle that supports monitor mode and set the WiFi USB dongle to monitor mode to listen and inject arbitrary WiFi frames. However, many WiFi USB dongles fail to meet our expectations. For example, some are not stable enough in monitor mode and often get stuck, which leads to the interruption of the fuzzing process. And some, we don't have complete control over some frame fields.\n\nOWFuzz is a WiFi protocol testing tool using OpenWiFi. OpenWiFi is an open-source WiFi protocol stack based on SDR that is fully compatible with Linux mac80211. It's driver takes advantage of the Linux kernel's supports (mac80211, cfg80211) for WiFi high MAC, so it can provide an interface to the application layer like a common WiFi USB dongle. In The hardware part, CSMA/CA protocol and other functions of WiFi low MAC layer are implemented on FPGA. It supports monitoring and injection of arbitrary WiFi frames\uff0cThe application layer software can also directly communicate with the OpenWiFi driver/FPGA/RF underlying functions through nl80211, which provides users with great autonomous and controllable ability. OWFuzz is the first to use OpenWiFi platform (Xilinx ZC706 dev board + FMCOMMS3) to implements a WiFi protocol fuzzing test framework, which supports the fuzzing test of all WiFi frames and the interactivity testing of WiFi protocols.\n\nThis research introduces a comprehensive overview of the OWFuzz. We will introduce its architecture, implementation (arbitrary frame and protocol interactivity fuzzing test), and how it works. And finally we will have a video demonstration.",
