  "Description": "Quark is one of the most popular analysis engines for hunting threat intelligence inside the APK files. Since it is rule-based, you can use the ones built-in or customize as needed.\n\nWith ideas decoded from criminal law, Quark has its unique angles for malware analysis. We developed a Dalvik bytecode loader that has tainted analysis inside but also defeats the obfuscation techniques used against reverse engineering. And surprisingly, the loader matches perfectly the design of our malware scoring system.\n\nFeatures/Progress in recent versions of Quark:\n1. Public Reports: AhMyth RAT and Roaming Mantis. And we give out all detection rules used in the reports\n2. Call Graphs for behavior detected\n3. Behavior Classification\n4. New Strategy for Generating Rules\n5. Open-Sourced all codes for rule generation\n6. Python Binding APIs: Made Quark easy to be integrated.\n7. Integrated to Intel Owl, BlackArch Linux, Pithus/Bazaar and APKLAB\n\nIn recent versions of Quark, we put huge efforts into making it more useful and practical. We have public reports that analyze classic samples like AhMyth RAT and Roaming Mantis. And we gave out all detection rules used in these reports!\n\nIn those reports, we show how users can use new features of Quark to quickly realize how the malware works. For example, malware analysts now can use Quark to generate call graphs of each behavior detected. And we also provide a feature that can automatically classify the detected behaviors in APK so as to boost up the storytelling of malware.\n\nMoreover, to make Quark a more practical tool to use, we developed a new strategy for generating detection rules. The new strategy improves the effectiveness of the rules and efficiency of the generating process. Even better, we open-sourced all codes for everyone.\n\nWith the usefulness of Quark, we now have developed python binding APIs for integration with other open-source projects. Now you can use Quark in projects like Intel Owl, BlackArch Linux, Pithus/Bazaar, and APKLAB. We'll be demonstrating how Quark enriches our partners during the presentation.",
