  "Description": "In a typical CTF challenge, the objective is to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the aim of a defensive or AppSec challenge is to rectify security vulnerabilities. Historically, building defensive challenges has been challenging due to the requirement for complex tools and infrastructure to manage and review player submissions.\nIn this presentation, we will introduce SecDim Play SDK: an open-source SDK designed for building defensive, AppSec, and AISec challenges. We will demonstrate how we model security attacks into software tests that can be used to assess players' security patches. In a live demo, we will explore the process of selecting real-world-inspired security vulnerabilities and transforming them into cloud-native apps with integrated security tests. Using Play SDK, we can create new challenges that focus on finding and fixing security vulnerabilities.",
