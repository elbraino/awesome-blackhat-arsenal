  "Description": "ELFieScanner looks to address the relative scarcity and immaturity of non-invasive portable in-memory malware scanning capabilities on Linux. It provides detections with greater context and thus value to the investigative capabilities of blue teams.\n\nELFieScanner inspects live process memory to detect a number of malicious techniques used by threat actors and in particular those which have been incorporated into Linux based user-mode rootkits. ELFieScanner inspects every running process (both x86/x64) and its corresponding loaded shared objects (libraries) to look for evil. It then outputs resultant detection telemetry into a format that can be easily ingested into a SEIM and viewed by Threat hunters or IR consultants. It has been designed to be both low impact and portable to work across numerous Linux distributions both old and new.\n\nELFieScanner uses 43 custom built and configurable memory heuristics that are constructed through live in-depth binary analysis of both the process image and a corresponding disk backed binary (if present), using this to identify malevolence. It offers four main detection capabilities that identify:\n\u2022 Shared Object injection techniques.\n\u2022 Entry point manipulation techniques.\n\u2022 Shellcode injection and Process hollowing.\n\u2022 API Hooking.\n\nThe scanner uses a low impact technique of memory collection that doesn't require interrupts to be sent to remote processes, thereby remaining passive and overcoming ptrace() anti-debug techniques used by malware. The configurability of the binary heuristics provides Blue teams a way to tailor the sensitivity of the detections for their particular environment if used as a persistent monitoring solution; or for incident responders to amass as many suspicious events as possible in one-time collection scenarios. In addition, a portable build is also provided overcoming the unwanted and intrusive default Linux behaviour of building tools on host.",
