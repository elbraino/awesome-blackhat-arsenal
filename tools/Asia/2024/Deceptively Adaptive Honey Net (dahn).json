  "Description": "Traditional honey nets offer static infrastructure and static responses. In DAHN, the infrastructure is abstracted, with lambda/gpt API (prompts stipulated) returning seemingly native responses to the threat actor, depending on the complexity index defined by the administrator. In other words, responses are dynamically crafted to entrap and retain threat actors, internal and external, in this environment for as long as possible, giving them a balance of false hope and realistic obstacles as they pass through our simulated layers of defense. Our AI-powered honey net mimics a given corporate environment to create a fictitious digital twin and embeds a controlled-level of simulated vulnerabilities/weaknesses to attract, distract, learn from, and attribute threat actors. The outputs are decoys, diversion, fingerprints, IoCs and IoAs, attributes, TTPs and behaviors, and used to augment threat detection and cyber defense strategies.",
