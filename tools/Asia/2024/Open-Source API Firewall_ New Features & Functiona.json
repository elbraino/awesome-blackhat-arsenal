  "Description": "The open-source API Firewall by Wallarm is designed to protect REST and GraphQL API endpoints in cloud-native environments. API Firewall provides API hardening with the use of a positive security model allowing calls that match a predefined API specification for requests and responses while rejecting everything else.\n\nThe key features of API Firewall are:\n- Secure REST and GraphQL API endpoints by blocking non-compliant requests/responses\n- Stop API data breaches by blocking malformed API responses\n- Discover Shadow API endpoints\n- Block attempts to use request/response parameters not specified in an OpenAPI specification\n- Validate JWT access tokens\n- Validate other OAuth 2.0 tokens using introspection endpoints\n- Denylist compromised API tokens, keys, and Cookies",
