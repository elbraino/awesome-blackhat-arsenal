📝 **Description:** Powered by the secure and robust Move language, emerging blockchains like Aptos and Sui are gaining rapid popularity. However, their increasingly complex smart contracts, which are often entrusted with valuable assets, need to provide users with the ability to verify the code safety. Unfortunately, it has become common for Move-based protocols to be deployed solely in low-level bytecode form, without accompanying source code. Therefore, reconstructing the original source of the on-chain contracts is essential for users and security researchers to thoroughly examine, evaluate and enhance security.


This talk introduces Revela, the first-ever open-source tool designed to decompile Move bytecode back to its original source code, empowering users and researchers with newfound transparency. We will explain how our tool leverages advanced static analysis techniques to recover the original source code structure, including modules, functions, and data types.


The presentation will include some live demonstrations of using Revela to decompile Move bytecode from online transactions. Additionally, we will showcase how our decompiler can be utilized to uncover vulnerabilities in closed-source protocols running on Aptos and Sui blockchains.

📝 **Description:** UEFI, an early stage in the computer booting process, is susceptible to attacks that disrupt the Secure Boot security mechanism , thereby allowing attackers to inject a type of malicious software known as "UEFI Rootkit." This specialized strain of malware adeptly conceals itself within SMM or BootLoader, granting malevolent actors surreptitious control over a victim's computer for a prolonged period.
Amidst ongoing research into UEFI security, researchers have discovered numerous SMM vulnerabilities, enhancing the robustness of UEFI. Remarkably, the emergence of tools like "efiexplorer" has significantlystreamlined the reverse engineering process for UEFI firmware.
Yet, contentment with the status quo proves untenable. Many latent UEFI vulnerabilities evade conventional detection techniques, with existing UEFI vulnerability detection tools primarily relying on fuzz testing or assembly instruction matching. Regrettably, no publicly available tool exists that can automatically detect and discover UEFI security vulnerabilities through data flow tracking analysis.
Efidrill - The First Open-Source IDA Plugin for Data Flow Analysis of UEFI Firmware.
Efidrill is a tool that enables data flow tracing, taint tracking, automated structure analysis, variable numerical prediction, and automated vulnerability detection for UEFI firmware.

📝 **Description:** Android has designed Parcel as its high-performance transport to pass objects across processes.
For classes to be serialized by Parcel, developers must implement the methods for writing and reading the object's properties to and from a Parcel container. The inconsistency between those methods implemented by careless developers introduces Parcel Mismatch bugs, often occurring in vendor-customed classes due to lack of public scrutiny.
Parcel Mismatch bugs can be abused by malicious applications to gain system privilege and have been massively exploited in the wild. However, due to the nature of those bugs, it cannot be solved by traditional source-to-sink taint analysis, currently no mature solutions exist to detect Parcel Mismatch bugs.
Here we proposes PMdet, a new fuzzing-based detection tool for Parcel Mismatch bugs.
PMdet is capable of handling different vendors' firmware without actual devices. It loads Parcelable classes from Android firmware, emulates the Android runtime environment for Parcel to work, and fuzz & monitors the serialization and deserialization procedures for mismatches.
We evaluate PMdet with several firmware from different Android vendors, and the results show that PMdet can detect Parcel Mismatch bugs of different causes, including 11 unique undisclosed mismatches, 6 of which are exploitable, and other 5 bugs that have been already confirmed and fixed.

🔗 **Link:** [Catching adversaries on Azure - Deception on Cloud](https://gist.github.com/Lysak/a0ca30a3e6732d39199b27c170a8cd28)  
📝 **Description:** Cloud is a widely adopted technology for organizations across the globe. It's very often a breeding ground for adversaries as the targets are now reachable to adversaries from anywhere in the world. More often than not, foothold into cloud is just a simple "password-spray" away. How to catch adversaries who are eyeing your crown jewels on cloud? Often adversaries are after your keys, secrets, data, emails, etc. A great way to protect is to put traps everywhere and wait for adversaries to fall into them. But deception on cloud is Hard to create, maintain, monitor, remove and most of all it's pricy. Cloud-Deception is a tool that intends to make it easier for individuals and organizations to deploy, monitor, maintain and remove deception with the most minimal price tag to it. This is done with the help of a CLI suite that creates real-like users (with known weak passwords), real-like resources (such as key vaults, storage accounts, etc.) and real-like identities (Managed identities). All these resources and identities have role assignments randomly assigned and the output is a glorious attack path that's very lucrative for an adversary to pursue. Cloud-deception enables logging automatically and creates alert rules so all you have to do relax and wait for adversaries. Cloud-deception currently supports Microsoft Azure. The talk will consist of a breath-taking tale of how to creation & monitoring of deception on cloud.

🔗 **Link:** [Deceptively Adaptive Honey Net (dahn)](https://github.com/nikhil130yadav/k-means-cluster-on-text-data/blob/master/output_30000words_3000Topics.txt)  
📝 **Description:** Traditional honey nets offer static infrastructure and static responses. In DAHN, the infrastructure is abstracted, with lambda/gpt API (prompts stipulated) returning seemingly native responses to the threat actor, depending on the complexity index defined by the administrator. In other words, responses are dynamically crafted to entrap and retain threat actors, internal and external, in this environment for as long as possible, giving them a balance of false hope and realistic obstacles as they pass through our simulated layers of defense. Our AI-powered honey net mimics a given corporate environment to create a fictitious digital twin and embeds a controlled-level of simulated vulnerabilities/weaknesses to attract, distract, learn from, and attribute threat actors. The outputs are decoys, diversion, fingerprints, IoCs and IoAs, attributes, TTPs and behaviors, and used to augment threat detection and cyber defense strategies.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Are you looking for an advanced tool that can help you detect and prevent sophisticated exploits on your systems? Look no further than eBPFShield. Let's take a technical look at some of the capabilities of this powerful technology:

DNS monitoring feature is particularly useful for detecting DNS tunneling, a technique used by attackers to bypass network security measures. By monitoring DNS queries, eBPFShield can help detect and block these attempts before any damage is done.

IP-Intelligence feature allows you to monitor outbound connections and check them against threat intelligence lists. This helps prevent command-and-control (C2) communications, a common tactic used by attackers to control compromised systems. By blocking outbound connections to known C2 destinations, eBPFShield can prevent attackers from exfiltrating sensitive data or delivering additional payloads to your system.

eBPFShield Machine Learning feature, you can develop and run advanced machine learning algorithms entirely in eBPF. We demonstrate a flow-based network intrusion detection system(IDS) based on machine learning entirely in eBPF. Our solution uses a decision tree and decides for each packet whether it is malicious or not, considering the entire previous context of the network flow.

eBPFShield Forensics helps address Linux security issues by analyzing system calls and kernel events to detect possible code injection into another process. It can also help identify malicious files and processes that may have been introduced to your system, allowing you to remediate any security issues quickly and effectively.

During the session, we'll delve deeper into these features and demonstrate how eBPFShield can help you protect your systems against even the most advanced threats.

<details><summary><strong>ELFieScanner: Advanced process memory threat detection on Linux</strong></summary>

![Asia 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202024-green) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Daniel Jary](https://img.shields.io/badge/Daniel%20Jary-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** ELFieScanner looks to address the relative scarcity and immaturity of non-invasive portable in-memory malware scanning capabilities on Linux. It provides detections with greater context and thus value to the investigative capabilities of blue teams.

ELFieScanner inspects live process memory to detect a number of malicious techniques used by threat actors and in particular those which have been incorporated into Linux based user-mode rootkits. ELFieScanner inspects every running process (both x86/x64) and its corresponding loaded shared objects (libraries) to look for evil. It then outputs resultant detection telemetry into a format that can be easily ingested into a SEIM and viewed by Threat hunters or IR consultants. It has been designed to be both low impact and portable to work across numerous Linux distributions both old and new.

ELFieScanner uses 43 custom built and configurable memory heuristics that are constructed through live in-depth binary analysis of both the process image and a corresponding disk backed binary (if present), using this to identify malevolence. It offers four main detection capabilities that identify:
• Shared Object injection techniques.
• Entry point manipulation techniques.
• Shellcode injection and Process hollowing.
• API Hooking.

The scanner uses a low impact technique of memory collection that doesn't require interrupts to be sent to remote processes, thereby remaining passive and overcoming ptrace() anti-debug techniques used by malware. The configurability of the binary heuristics provides Blue teams a way to tailor the sensitivity of the detections for their particular environment if used as a persistent monitoring solution; or for incident responders to amass as many suspicious events as possible in one-time collection scenarios. In addition, a portable build is also provided overcoming the unwanted and intrusive default Linux behaviour of building tools on host.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Containers are the most popular technology for deploying modern applications. SPOILER ALERT: bypassing well-known security controls is also popular. In this talk, we explain how to use the recent updates in Falco, a CNCF open-source container security tool, to detect drifts and fileless malware in containerized environments.

As a best practice, containers should be considered immutable. Early this year, Falco introduced new features to detect container drift via OverlayFS, which can spot if binaries are added or modified after the container's deployment. New binaries are often a sign of an ongoing attack.

Of course, attackers can also use more advanced evasion techniques to stay hidden. By using in-memory, fileless execution, attackers can bypass most of the security controls such as drift detection, and still reach their goals with no stress.

To combat fileless attacks, Falco has also added memfd-based fileless execution thanks to its visibility superpowers on Linux kernel system calls. Combining Falco's existing runtime security capabilities with these two new detection layers forms the foundation of an in-depth defense strategy for cloud-native workloads.

We will walk you through real-world scenarios based on recent threats and malware, demoing how Falco can help detect and respond to these malicious behaviors and comparing drift and fileless attack paths.

🔗 **Link:** [Slips: A machine-learning based, free-software, P2P Network Intrusion Prevention System](https://github.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS)  
📝 **Description:** For the last 7 years we developed Slips, a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free-software network IDS using machine learning. Slips profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections inside each time window in order to also *unblock* IPs. Slips has more than 20 modules that detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected device. It is an network EDR with the capability to also protect small networks.

Slips consumes multiple packets and flows, exporting data to SIEMs. More importantly, Slips is the first IDS to automatically create a local P2P network of sensors, where instances share detections following a trust model resilient to adversaries..

Slips works in several directionality modes. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles, or both. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network, which is a novel technique.

Among its modules, Slips includes the download/manage of external Threat Intelligence feed (including our laboratory's own TI feed), whois/asn/geocountry enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scanning detection (vertical and horizontal) on flows, long connection detection, etc. The decisions to block profiles or not are based on ensembling
algorithms. The P2P module connects to other Slips to share detection alerts.

Slips can read packets from the network, pcap, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files and summaries. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol.

Slips web interface allows to clearly see the detections and behaviors, including threat inteligence enhancements. The interface can show multiple Slips runs, summarize whois/asn/geocountry information and much more.

📝 **Description:** Most organisations put significant effort into maintaining their public GitHub repositories. They safeguard these repositories against various security vulnerabilities and routinely scan for sensitive information, ensuring thorough checks have been carried out before making anything public. However, an aspect that is often overlooked is the monitoring of the public activities of their organisation's users.

Developers within organisations frequently experiment and test ideas in a public setting, which may inadvertently include sensitive code, hardcoded credentials, secrets, internal URLs, and other proprietary information. This oversight can lead to significant security risks, making it crucial for organisations to monitor such activities to prevent potential data breaches.

Recent studies on data breaches reveal a startling trend. The leakage of secrets and sensitive information often occurs via individual repositories, rather than organisational ones. This fact underscores the importance of monitoring not just the organisation's repositories but also those created and maintained by individual users.

This talk aims to shed light on such cases related to GitHub. We will delve into real-world examples, discuss the common pitfalls, and suggest effective strategies to guard against these potential security risks.

📝 **Description:** Organizations often lack the necessary resources and diverse skills to identify hidden vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Bug bounty program, which incentivizes ethical hackers to report bugs, emerged to bridge the skills gap and address the imbalance between attackers and defenders.

However, integrating bug bounty program into security strategies remains challenging due to limitations in efficiency, security, budget, and the scalability of consulting-based or third-party solutions.

Gerobug is the first open-source bug bounty platform that allows organizations to establish their own bug bounty platform easily and securely, free of charge.

📝 **Description:** entestMuse is not just a tool; it is the embodiment of the Iron Man philosophy in cybersecurity. Like Tony Stark's exoskeleton, which enhances his abilities while allowing him to retain control and focus on higher-level strategies, PentestMuse augments the capabilities of offensive cybersecurity professionals. It automates the repetitive, precision-dependent tasks of penetration testing - much like the meticulous data collection and alerting in a monitoring system - allowing experts to concentrate on tasks requiring human ingenuity and judgment.

Adhering to the [Compensatory Principle](https://www.notion.so/Compensatory-Principle-efdc076b70d84d1797ab3469a9955ba9?pvs=21), PentestMuse recognizes the distinct strengths of human intuition and machine precision. It executes complex operations autonomously, similar to a state-machine-driven repair system, but steps aside when human intervention is preferable or necessary. This approach mirrors the collaboration between Iron Man's suit and Tony Stark, where automation enhances human skills without overshadowing them.

The design of PentestMuse ensures that the creativity and learning opportunities for cybersecurity professionals are not stifled. The tool works as a partner, handling the 'boring stuff' and late-night work, thereby enabling human experts to focus on creative problem-solving and system optimization. This collaboration is akin to Iron Man's suit: an advanced assistant that elevates the human operator to new levels of efficiency and effectiveness.

In conclusion, PentestMuse is a testament to the power of AI in enhancing human capabilities in offensive security, rather than replacing them. It's a system more Iron Man, less Ultron - a perfect blend of human intelligence and machine efficiency, designed to tackle the ever-evolving challenges of the digital world.

📝 **Description:** In a typical CTF challenge, the objective is to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the aim of a defensive or AppSec challenge is to rectify security vulnerabilities. Historically, building defensive challenges has been challenging due to the requirement for complex tools and infrastructure to manage and review player submissions.
In this presentation, we will introduce SecDim Play SDK: an open-source SDK designed for building defensive, AppSec, and AISec challenges. We will demonstrate how we model security attacks into software tests that can be used to assess players' security patches. In a live demo, we will explore the process of selecting real-world-inspired security vulnerabilities and transforming them into cloud-native apps with integrated security tests. Using Play SDK, we can create new challenges that focus on finding and fixing security vulnerabilities.

📝 **Description:** Problem Statement:
At Companies secrets are being used across various environments for integration and authentication services. However, managing the secrets and preventing incidents from leakage of secrets have been challenging for the organisation. Existing solutions are centralised and warrants considerable code change to be implemented. Following are the problem statement to be resolved:

- To manage and secure the secrets that are currently in plain text across Git, IaC templates, and workloads.
- To implement a secrets manager that is developer friendly and reduces operational overheads.
- To develop a solution that does not expose the secrets even at the compromise of entities storing the credentials. For example, to protect our secrets from CodeCov like incidents.

Solution:
We have developed a Git based secret manager which adopts a secure and decentralised approach to managing, sharing, and storing the secrets. In this approach secrets are stored in an encrypted form in Github repositories of the teams.

Keys Principles
This implementation follows two important principles
-A developer can be allowed to add or modify secrets, however should not be allowed to view them
-An environment should have a single identity that gives access to all necessary credentials irrespective of the number of projects that are deployed.

🔗 **Link:** [EMBA – From firmware to exploit](https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/wiki/Referring-sites-and-talks)  
📝 **Description:** IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) are the current buzzwords for networked devices on which our modern society is based on. In this area, the used operating systems are summarized with the term firmware. The devices themselves, also called embedded devices, are essential in the private and industrial environments as well as in the so-called critical infrastructure.
Penetration testing of these systems is quite complex as we have to deal with different architectures, optimized operating systems and special protocols. EMBA is an open-source firmware analyzer with the goal to simplify and optimize the complex task of firmware security analysis. EMBA supports the penetration tester with the automated detection of 1-day vulnerabilities on binary level. This goes far beyond the plain CVE detection: With EMBA you always know which public exploits are available for the target firmware. Besides the detection of already known vulnerabilities, EMBA also supports the tester on the next 0-day. For this, EMBA identifies critical binary functions, protection mechanisms and services with network behavior on a binary level. There are many other features built into EMBA, such as fully automated firmware extraction, finding file system vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, and more.
EMBA is the open-source firmware scanner, created by penetration testers for penetration testers.

🔗 **Link:** [Genzai - The IoT Security Toolkit](https://github.com/umair9747/Genzai/blob/main/docs/documentation.md)  
📝 **Description:** With a widespread increase in the adoption of IoT or Internet of Things devices, their security has become the need of the hour. Cyberattacks against IoT devices have grown rapidly and with platforms like Shodan, it has become much easier to scroll through the entire internet and look for just the right target which an attacker wants. To combat such threats it has become necessary for individuals and organisations to secure their IoT devices but when it becomes harder to keep track of them, the chances of unpatched loopholes increase.

To address this concern and give the users a better visibility of their assets, introducing Genzai! Genzai helps users keep track of IoT device-related web interfaces, scan them for security flaws and scan against custom policies for vendor-specific or all cases.
Tool features:
- Bruteforce panels for vendor-specific and generic/common password lists to look for default creds
- Use pre-defined templates/payloads to look for vulnerabilities
- Users can specify scan policies for scanning vendor-specific or all entries
