  "Description": "The AI VPN is an AI-based traffic analysis tool to detect and block threats, ensuring enhanced privacy protection automatically. It offers modular management of VPN accounts, automated network traffic analysis, and incident reporting. Using the free software IDS system Slips, the AI VPN employs machine learning and threat intelligence for comprehensive traffic analysis. Multiple VPN technologies, such as OpenVPN and Wireguard, are supported, and in-line blocking technologies like Pi-hole provide additional protection.\n\nDeveloped to assist journalists, activists, and NGOs in combating targeted digital attacks, the AI VPN aims to deliver a user-friendly, efficient, and automated solution for network forensics on devices without requiring physical access. Users experience seamless Internet connectivity, akin to conventional VPNs, while the AI VPN server conducts traffic analysis and reporting.\n\nThe AI VPN is designed as a modular collection of micro-services using Docker technology. Ten modules currently handle diverse functionalities such as management, database operations, communication, multiple VPNs, PiHole integration, Slips, and comprehensive reporting.",
