  "Description": "So far, there are many tools for vulnerability scanning, such as Mobsf, Yaazhini, 360 microscope, Tencent King Kong system. These tools have been able to cover a large part of the app vulnerability and many have supported dynamic and static vulnerability scanning, but there are a lot of false alert. The purpose of dynamic and static combination is also to improve the accuracy of vulnerability scanning, thereby reducing the rate of false alert, and also can make up for the shortcomings each other, so as to find out the vulnerabilities as much as possible, but the system is too large, the maintenance cost is high, and the scanning result is not ideally, it would be better that there is a simple and efficient tool.\n\nSAST is a static android application vulnerability scanning tool. The architecture is simple and easy to use, and the maintenance cost is very low. Although it is a static scanning tool, the accuracy is very high. It is consists of androguard and vulnerability patterns. Because androguard is a powerful open source tool, it is highly customizable and provides excellent support in apk analysis. The vulnerability pattern mainly integrates the known and the latest app vulnerability features. Each pattern is independent of each other, no influence on each other, and strong scalability, so it is fast to update a new pattern and have a good performance. At the same time, it is used to scan various types of top500 applications in Google Play, and found out a lot of potential security issues for many applications, and we submitted some vulnerabilities to the vendors, which are currently being processed.",
