  "Description": "Security incidents are usually created by alerts or events, which are based on a small set of forwarded logs. When a server is suspected to be compromised, we go back to the host machine to perform forensics on the rest of the logs to investigate the network traffic and endpoint.\n\nSample Analysing Forensics Examiner (SAFE) enables security administrators/engineers to run automated forensics investigations effortlessly on a selected set of machines, either specified or via sampling, to get individual baseline threat scores on the likelihood of a server compromise. A number of logs, including web server, syslog, system, network logs are surveyed for this analysis. With SAFE, security engineers can easily survey a selected pool of servers to hunt for any potential infection or compromise.",
