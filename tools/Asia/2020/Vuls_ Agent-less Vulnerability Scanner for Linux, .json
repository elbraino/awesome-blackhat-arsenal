  "Description": "Over 10,000 new vulnerabilities are registered on the NVD each year. Constantly monitoring new vulnerabilities and keeping a manual inventory of installed software to determine which devices are affected is necessary. Without automation, vulnerability lifecycle managed imposes huge burdens and challenges.\n\nHaving personally experienced these challenges, Kota Kanbe created Vuls, an open source vulnerability scanner for Linux and FreeBSD [https://github.com/future-architect/vuls].\n\nWith users worldwide, Vuls has over 7,000 GitHub stars and is the highest-ranked security-tool https://github.com/topics/security-tools\n\nVuls lets you know which servers and software are affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities. Using multiple detection methods and data sources including changelog, Package Manager, NVD and OVAL, Vuls is more accurate than other open source scanners.\n\nAdditionally, using CPE offers a wide detection range. Vuls not only detects vulnerabilities in OS packages but also in non-OS packages such as libraries for programming languages and network devices. https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html Wordpress vulnerability scanning(core, plugins, themes) is also supported. Scan WordPress ... https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-wordpress.html\n\nAnother important feature is the speed; by using parallel processing, numerous servers can be scanned at high speeds with most scans completed within 10 seconds.\n\nVuls supports major distributions of Linux and FreeBSD as well as containers such as Docker, LXC and LXD.\n\nVuls is extremely easy to set up since it connects to other servers via SSH for the scans. Of course, it can also be used to scan servers locally without SSH.\n\nVuls is a Dynamic Scanner which logs in running servers. This means that it's possible to acquire the useful state of the server for system administrators. For instance, Vuls will let you know if there are processes affected by an update and when daemons forgot to perform a restart after the update.\n\nWith non-intrusive scans, Vuls works well with Continuous Integration and can help find vulnerabilities very quickly by conducting scans every day.\n\nHow can a system administrator automate vulnerability lifecycle management?",
