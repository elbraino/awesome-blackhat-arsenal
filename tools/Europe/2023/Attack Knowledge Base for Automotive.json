  "Description": "Ensuring cybersecurity in the automotive sector is more crucial than ever, especially with the rising intricacies and susceptibilities of vehicle-connected systems. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard serves as a beacon in this endeavor. However, compliance with this standard reveals discernible information disparities across its V-model phases: Concept & Design, Implementation, and Verification & Validation. Addressing these gaps is paramount for cohesive vehicle cybersecurity.\n\nTo tackle these hurdles, we introduce the \"Attack Knowledge Base for Automotive.\" Inspired and aligned with the ATT&CK framework, this tool aids in seamless compliance with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard. We will demonstrate its efficacy in delivering a thorough and objective outcome during Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). Moreover, it bridges information lacunas across the lifecycle, enabling the red team to synergize insights from earlier stages with our Attack Knowledge Base, ensuring holistic automotive cybersecurity.",
