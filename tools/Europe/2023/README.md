📝 **Description:** For a long time, BloodHound has been the go-to tool for many red teams to uncover possible lateral movement paths in an environment. Fortunately, there are blue teams that also use it to great value. However, there are a lot of teams that struggle to use it due to lack of time or knowledge. On top of that, keeping the information in the BloodHound database up-to-date and using it for automatic detection and enrichment is often not implemented.

Introducing FalconHound, a toolkit that integrates with Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, the Azure Graph API, Neo4j and the BloodHound API to get the most out of your data. Some of its features allow it to track sessions, changes to the environment, alerts, and incidents on your entities and much, much more. All in near-real time!

This additional bi-directional context allows you to make better decisions and focus on the most important alerts and incidents. Allowing you, for instance, to run new path calculations frequently based on modifications, sessions or alerts and respond to these attacks which are very hard to detect without this information.

🔗 **Link:** [Honeyscanner: a vulnerability analyzer for Honeypots](https://gist.github.com/aristofanischionis/a9d18cb0c8b801bbaf50b51a72fe9405)  
📝 **Description:** Honeypots are now considered a well-studied cyber-deception mechanism that can assist in defending networks as well as identifying new attack trends. However, recent research has shown that honeypots may also be vulnerable to attacks; especially fingerprinting identification ones. Moreover, many open-source honeypots lack an external security analysis and are often deployed with their default settings.

We present honeyscanner, an open-source vulnerability analyzer for honeypots. It is designed to automatically attack a given honeypot, to determine if the honeypot is vulnerable to specific types of cyber-attacks. The analyzer uses a variety of attacks, ranging from identifying vulnerable software libraries to DoS, and fuzzing attacks. In the end, an evaluation report is provided to the honeypot administrator, including advice on how to enhance the security of the honeypot.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Containers are the most popular technology for deploying modern applications. SPOILER ALERT: bypassing well-known security controls is also popular. In this talk, we explain how to use the recent updates in Falco, a CNCF open-source container security tool, to detect drifts and fileless malware in containerized environments.

As a best practice, containers should be considered immutable. Early this year, Falco introduced new features to detect container drift via OverlayFS, which can spot if binaries are added or modified after the container's deployment. New binaries are often a sign of an ongoing attack.

Of course, attackers can also use more advanced evasion techniques to stay hidden. By using in-memory, fileless execution, attackers can bypass most of the security controls such as drift detection and still reach their goals with no stress.

To combat fileless attacks, Falco has also added memfd-based fileless execution thanks to its visibility superpowers on Linux kernel system calls. Combining Falco's existing runtime security capabilities with these two new detection layers forms the foundation of a defense in depth strategy for cloud-native workloads.

We will walk you through real-world scenarios based on recent threats and malware, demoing how Falco can help detect and respond to these malicious behaviors and comparing both drift and fileless attack paths.

<details><summary><strong>Slips: A machine-learning based, free-software, P2P Network Intrusion Prevention System</strong></summary>

![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Sebastian Garcia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sebastian%20Garcia-informational) ![Alya Gomaa](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alya%20Gomaa-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Slips: A machine-learning based, free-software, P2P Network Intrusion Prevention System](https://github.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS)  
📝 **Description:** For the last 7 years we developed Slips, a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free-software network IDS using machine learning. Slips profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections inside each time window in order to also *unblock* IPs. Slips has more than 20 modules that detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected device. It is an network EDR with the capability to also protect small networks.

Slips consumes multiple packets and flows, exporting data to SIEMs. More importantly, Slips is the first IDS to automatically create a local P2P network of sensors, where instances share detections following a trust model resilient to adversaries..

Slips works in several directionality modes. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles, or both. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network, which is a novel technique.

Among its modules, Slips includes the download/manage of external Threat Intelligence feed (including our laboratory's own TI feed), whois/asn/geocountry enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scanning detection (vertical and horizontal) on flows, long connection detection, etc. The decisions to block profiles or not are based on ensembling
algorithms. The P2P module connects to other Slips to share detection alerts.

Slips can read packets from the network, pcap, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files and summaries. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol.

Slips web interface allows to clearly see the detections and behaviors, including threat inteligence enhancements. The interface can show multiple Slips runs, summarize whois/asn/geocountry information and much more.

📝 **Description:** SSH to Any Device with No Ports Open
Make your devices reachable while eliminating network attack surfaces & reducing administrative overhead.

Atsign's patent pending core technology is engineered to deliver the following benefits:
Addressability
Atsign's core technology uses identifiers which replace the need to manage IP addresses. If you remember the atSign (Atsign's version of an address), you can look up the IP address and port in the atDirectory which manages this information for you.
Reachability
‍Atsign's core technology provides each device with its own microserver which makes it reachable from anywhere on the internet.
No open ports (no network attack surface) on the device
Connections are always made from the device to the microserver, meaning that no ports ever need to be opened on devices using this technology.
End-to-end encrypted
Information is automatically encrypted on the edge devices before it is sent over Atsign's control plane.
Zero Trust
Atsign's technology is designed such that cryptographic keys are only stored at the edge device. No third party or intermediary ever possesses the decryption keys which are required to access the information. You don't need to trust any of the microservers, because they never see information in the clear.
In other words, sending information using Atsign's control plane requires no open ports and is fully edge-to-edge encrypted, all without needing to know the IP address of the device!

📝 **Description:** YAWNING-TITAN is an abstract, graph based cyber-security simulation environment that supports the training of intelligent agents for autonomous cyber operations. YAWNING-TITAN focuses on providing a fast simulation to support the development of defensive autonomous agents who face off against probabilistic red agents. YAWNING-TITAN has been designed with the following things in mind:

• Simplicity over complexity;
• Minimal Hardware Requirements;
• Operating System agnostic;
• Support for a wide range of algorithms;
• Enhanced agent / policy evaluation support;
• Flexible environment and game rule configuration;
• Generation of evaluation episode visualisations (gifs).

YAWNING-TITAN contains a small number of specific, self-contained OpenAI Gym environments for autonomous cyber defence research, which are great for learning and debugging; it also provides a flexible, highly configurable generic environment which can be used to represent a range of scenarios of increasing complexity and scale. The generic environment only needs a network topology and a settings file to create an OpenAI Gym compliant environment which enables open research and enhanced reproducibility.

When training and evaluating an agent, YAWNING-TITAN can be run from either a command-line interface, or a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows the underlying Python to be executed without need for a command line interface or knowledge of the python language. The GUI also integrates with a customised version Cytoscape JS which has been extended to work directly with YAWNING-TITAN, and allows users to directly interface with network topologies that subsequently updates a database of stored networks. Both the command-line interface and the GUI provide read-outs throughout agent training and evaluation, as well as generation of a final summary.

<details><summary><strong>MetaHub: Automating Ownership, Context and Impact Assessments in Security Findings</strong></summary>

![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Gabriel Alejandro Soltz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gabriel%20Alejandro%20Soltz-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [MetaHub: Automating Ownership, Context and Impact Assessments in Security Findings](https://github.com/gabrielsoltz/metahub)  
📝 **Description:** Security findings from automated sources such as CSPMs, software vulnerability scanners, or compliance scanners often overwhelm security teams with excessive, generic, context-less information. You may have heard countless times that context in security is key, so why don't these tools provide you with more of it? Simply put, they were not designed to do so.

This shortcoming means that determining ownership and impact can be time-consuming, leading to critical vulnerabilities going unnoticed, and causing unnecessary noise or friction between security teams and other departments.

My proposed demo introduces MetaHub, a tool designed to address these issues by automating the three essential stages of security finding assessment: owner determination, contextualization, and impact definition. Leveraging metadata through MetaChecks, MetaTags, MetaTrails, and MetaAccount, MetaHub provides a detailed, context-aware assessment of each finding.

By integrating MetaHub, teams can significantly reduce false positives, streamline the detection and resolution of security findings, and strategically tailor their scanner selection to minimize unnecessary noise. The ability to concentrate on meaningful, high-impact issues will be the primary focus of the demo.

MetaHub relies on the ASFF format for ingesting security findings and can consume data from AWS Security Hub or any ASFF-supported scanner like Prowler, ElectricEye, or Inspector. This compatibility means you can continue using the scanners you already rely on but add what's missing to those findings: Ownership, Context, and Impact.

MetaHub also generates powerful visual reports and is designed for use as a CLI tool or within automated workflows, such as AWS Security Hub custom actions or AWS Lambda functions.

The automation of context, ownership, and impact is not commonly addressed by open-source tools; MetaHub introduces a solution to this problem that aims to be agnostic to the source scanner.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** SupplyShield is a comprehensive supply chain security framework aimed at defending against the increasingly sophisticated attacks posed by software supply chain vulnerabilities. With numerous organizations hosting hundreds of micro-services and thousands of builds occurring daily, effectively monitoring the software supply chain to construct the final application becomes a complex challenge. This is where SupplyShield can assist any organization in seamlessly integrating this framework into their Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure software supply chain security.

The current framework version is predominantly designed for the AWS environment. Any organization utilizing AWS infrastructure can seamlessly implement this framework with minimal effort via AWS CloudFormation templates to enhance the security of their supply chain. The framework mainly focuses on generating and maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and performing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for all the micro-services within an organization. The scans are event-driven, targeting the final micro-service image pushed into AWS ECR. As a result, it generates an SBOM of base image binaries and 3rd-party packages introduced by developers, and performs SCA on top of that. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the software components involved in the overall development of a micro service.

Built with scalability in mind, SupplyShield is capable of generating an SBOM and performing SCA in a CI/CD environment where thousands of builds take place daily. SupplyShield enables the rapid detection of zero-day vulnerabilities, such as the log4j exploit, even for organizations with over 100 micro-services, significantly reducing the Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) to mere minutes. This significantly simplifies the tasks of both security engineers and developers in identifying and managing patches for events like the log4j vulnerability. The framework also offers a dashboard for developers and security engineers, presenting relevant metrics and actionable insights.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** DeRF (Detection Replay Framework) is an "Attacks As A Service" framework, allowing the emulation of offensive techniques and generation of repeatable detection samples from a UI - without the need for End Users to install software, use the CLI or possess credentials in the target environment.

Notable built-in attack modules are listed below with a complete list of all built-in attack techniques in The DeRF documentation.

o AWS | EC2 Steal Instance Credentials
o AWS | Retrieve a High Number of Secrets Manager secrets.
o AWS | Stop CloudTrail
o AWS | Execute Commands on EC2 Instance via User Data
o AWS | EC2 Download User Data
o AWS | EC2 Share EBS Snapshot
o GCP | Impersonate Service Account

Similar to other tools focused on detection generation, the DeRF deploys and manages the target cloud infrastructure, which is manipulated to simulate attacker techniques.
Terraform is used to manage all resources, deploying (and destroying) hosted attack techniques and target infrastructure in under 3 minutes.

While a bring-your-own-Infrastructure (BYOI) model isn't currently supported, maintaining The DeRF infrastructure costs less than $10/month for Google Cloud and $5/month for AWS. The tool's convenient deployment model means you can use it as needed rather than continuously running 24/7. Check out the deployment guide for more details.

The initial release of The DeRF encompasses a wide range of prevalent cloud attack techniques, providing your organization with ample resources for training, controls testing, and executing on attack scenarios. However, as needs evolve, you may need to expand beyond the initial set and introduce your own custom attack modules. With The DeRF, this process is simplified. All attack techniques are defined as Google Cloud Workflows, which can be deployed as additional terraform modules within your forked version of the codebase.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** PowerAutomate C2 is a framework designed to emulate "Living Off the Cloud" attacks, leveraging only legitimate functions in PowerAutomate.

The battlefield has shifted from the endpoint to the cloud in evolving cyber warfare. This shift can increase the wealth of useful information the cloud offers, making it a more lucrative target for attackers. This transition introduces a new tactic, "Living Off the Cloud," which has become increasingly prevalent in cyber-attacks.

PowerAutomate, a powerful cloud-based automation platform also known as the "New PowerShell", allows for the execution of these "Living Off the Cloud" attacks. PowerAutomate is particularly attractive to attackers as it enables stealth activities. One characteristic is a client-free execution which carries out an attack that leaves no logs on the client and completes entirely in the cloud. It ensures no traces are left on the endpoint, network devices, or within the Office 365 environment. Despite this, continuous access to PowerAutomate on the victim's user profile is required to execute and manage the flow of an attack. PowerAutomate provides a connector known as PowerAutomate Management to address this challenge. This connector allows for managing the flow itself, thus eliminating the need for persistent access to the victim's user profile.

In this presentation, we introduce the concept and demonstration of PowerAutomate C2, which utilizes the basic functions of PowerAutomate and exclusively employs the PowerAutomate Management connector. PowerAutomate C2 is built on a Python-based platform, enabling control over PowerAutomate's flow without a GUI-based low-code interface. This approach also facilitates the remote creation and deletion of flows with no logs, even after access to PowerAutomate is lost. For C2 communication, we have implemented support for HTTP(S) and storage services like Dropbox, enhancing the flexibility and stealth of the operation. We also alert the risk of improper permission to use PowerAutomate Management.

📝 **Description:** Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are commonly believed to offer their customers protection against denial of service (DoS) attacks. However, our research reveals a novel architecture vulnerability in CDNs, enabling attackers to turn globally distributed CDN Infrastructure into powerful DDoS amplifiers.

In this talk, we draw the analogy to a military tactic used in World War II and introduce a new class of pulsing denial-of-service attacks. We demonstrate how CDNs can be exploited to concentrate low-rate attacking requests into short, high-bandwidth pulse waves, resulting in a pulsing DDoS attack to saturate targeted TCP services periodically.

We tested five leading CDN vendors and found all of them are susceptible to this attack. By mounting an attack against our own Web site, we show that attackers can use it to achieve peak bandwidths over 1000 times greater than their upload bandwidth, seriously degrading the performance and availability of target services. We have reported our findings to all tested CDNs and received positive feedback.

As this problem is rooted in the inherent nature of CDN forwarding networks, it is difficult to eliminate entirely. We discuss possible mitigation strategies for this emerging threat. We believe it is important that CDN operators and their customers be aware of this attack so that they can protect themselves accordingly.

📝 **Description:** In this tool demo, we will present GDBFuzz, a new open source fuzzer that leverages hardware breakpoints and program analysis to test embedded systems. Existing fuzzers for embedded devices most often run on an emulation of the code, but GDBFuzz runs on the device itself. This allows GDBFuzz to fuzz devices which do not have emulations. Its integration with Ghidra allows it to fuzz closed-source applications. All the tool needs is access to the commonly used GDB remote protocol.

We will explain how GDBFuzz combines hardware breakpoints with control flow relationships to guide fuzzing exploration. We will also detail its underlying analyses and techniques that were recently published at the academic conference ISSTA. GDBFuzz detected three previously unknown bugs in open-source embedded software that were confirmed by the vendors. GDBFuzz is the first tool allowing to fuzz embedded systems at scale.

To demonstrate the fuzzer's ease of use and efficiency, we will run an interactive demo on multiple devices (including ARM and MSP430 processors). At the end of the session, attendees will know how to use GDBFuzz to test their own embedded systems.

🔗 **Link:** [SafeNet - Securing Your Network From Your Research](https://github.com/cyberark/SafeNet)  
📝 **Description:** In the world of Cyber Security and especially malware research and reverse engineering, we often put ourselves and our PCs at constant risk, and a common method to mitigate this is by using a Virtual Machine and while this method is great for keeping our PCs safe, it does not address a larger issue - our network.

This is true especially now, with the rise in popularity of remote and hybrid work where we have to research on networks that lack corporate-level protection solutions like our homes!

SafeNet is a solution to keep our research labs and dirty virtual machines connected to the internet, all while segregating them from our local network and keeping it safe, ensuring that we can continue researching while staying as safe as possible.

🔗 **Link:** [Tracing Golang Windows API calls with gftrace](https://github.com/leandrofroes)  
📝 **Description:** gftrace is a Windows API tracing tool that abuses the way that the Golang runtime works to monitor all the API calls performed by Go applications. The project is a command line tool that only requires the user to specify what Windows functions to trace. Since the tool was designed to work with Go applications specifically it provides a very clean output based on the calls the main package performs and filters all the noise the Go runtime produces.

The tool is also very portable and reliable since it works with several (if not all) Go versions and only interacts with the Go runtime, without touching any Windows API call. gftrace can be very handy for fast malware triage and reverse engineering in general, specially when it comes to obfuscated, stripped and/or trojanized samples.

<details><summary><strong>Unblob: A Firmware Extraction Framework</strong></summary>

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** One of the major challenges of embedded security analysis is the sound and safe extraction of arbitrary firmware.

Specialized tools that can extract information from those firmwares already exists, but we wanted something smarter that could identify both start offset of a specific chunk (e.g. filesystem, compression stream, archive) and end offset.

We stick to the format standard as much as possible when deriving these offsets, and we clearly define what we want out of identified chunks (e.g., not extracting meta-data to disk, padding removal).

This strategy helps us feed known valid data to extractors and precisely identify unidentified chunks, turning unknown unknowns into known unknowns.

Given the modular design of unblob and the ever expanding repository of supported formats, unblob could be used in areas outside of embedded security such as data recovery, memory forensics, or malware analysis.

unblob has been developed with the following objectives in mind:

* Accuracy - chunk start offsets are identified using battle tested rules, while end offsets are computed according to the format's standard without deviating from it. We minimize false positives as much as possible by validating header structures and discarding overflowing chunks.
* Security - unblob does not require elevated privileges to run. It's heavily tested and has been fuzz tested against a large corpus of files and firmware images. We rely on up-to-date third party dependencies that are locked to limit potential supply chain issues. We use safe extractors that we audited and fixed where required (e.g., path traversal in ubi_reader, path traversal in jefferson, integer overflow in Yara).
* Extensibility - unblob exposes an API that can be used to write custom format handlers and extractors in no time.
* Speed - we want unblob to be blazing fast, that's why we use multi-processing by default, make sure to write efficient code, use memory-mapped files, and use Hyperscan as high-performance matching library. Computation intensive functions are written in Rust and called from Python using specific bindings.
