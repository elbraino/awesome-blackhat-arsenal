  "Description": "This talk focuses on the unique process of transforming security attacks into software tests for building secure programming challenges using an open-source SDK, 'Play'. A practical workshop where we explore the mechanics of choosing real-world-inspired security vulnerabilities, and transforming them into cloud-native apps with integrated security tests which can then be played as challenges. These challenge provides a new dimension to the traditional Capture The Flag experiences, emphasizing not just the identification but the remediation of vulnerabilities",
