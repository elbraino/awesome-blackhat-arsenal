  "Description": "Docker Exploitation Framework is a cross-platform framework that is focused on attacking container environment (think kubernetes, docker etc). It can identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors. It also helps to automate different stages of a successful kill-chain through features such as:\n- Vulnerability Scanning\n- Container breakouts\n- Pod2Pod Lateral movement\n- File layers deep inspection and extraction\n- Attack Surface discovery and mapping\n- Privilege Escalation etc\n\nIt uses a agent/server architecture. The agents are modular and are designed to be portable with minimal dependencies for maximum compatibility in restricted containers. This is a tool created for pentesters and red teamers.",
