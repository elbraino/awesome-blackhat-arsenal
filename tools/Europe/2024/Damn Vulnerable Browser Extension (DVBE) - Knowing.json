  "Description": "In the ever expanding world of Browser Extensions, security remains a big concern. As the demand of the feature-rich extensions increases, priority is given to functionality over robustness, which makes way for vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. The danger increases even more for organizations handling sensitive data like banking details, PII, confidential org reports etc.\n\nDamn Vulnerable Browser Extension (DVBE) is an open-source vulnerable browser extension, designed to shed light on the importance of writing secure browser extensions and to educate the developers and security professionals about the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that are found in the browser extensions, how they are found & how they impact business. This built-to-be vulnerable extension can be used to learn, train & exploit browser extension related vulnerabilities.",
