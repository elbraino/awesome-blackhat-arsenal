  "Description": "Tabby is an automated vulnerability discovery ecosystem specifically designed for Java, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of security researchers in identifying vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and commercial applications. It introduces a phased taint analysis algorithm based on code property graphs, ensuring both scalability and repeatability throughout the analysis process. The ecosystem consists of four main components:\n\n- Tabby Core: The heart of Tabby, this component leverages a taint analysis engine to transform code into graph data. It supports custom plugins, allowing users to inject their own logic into processes such as function identification and call edge creation, enabling precise recognition of specific code patterns.\n- Tabby-Path-Finder: Utilizes Neo4j's powerful graph traversal capabilities to perform inter-procedural taint analysis on graph databases.\n- Tabby-Vul-Finder: Imports tainted data into the graph database and supports configurable automated vulnerability discovery, streamlining the detection process.\n- Tabby-Intellij-Plugin: Integrates with IntelliJ IDEA to provide quick navigation from graph data to code, significantly improving the efficiency of vulnerability analysis.\n\nWith Tabby, you can uncover a wide range of Java-related vulnerabilities, including classic web vulnerabilities (such as those involving various frameworks and servlets), Netty-style RPC vulnerabilities, and diverse deserialization exploitation chains. The art of Java vulnerability hunting is simplified into cypherized database queries. To date, Tabby has helped discover over 100 zero-day vulnerabilities, with CVEs filed for several open-source projects, including XStream and Dubbo.",
