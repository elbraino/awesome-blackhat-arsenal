  "Description": "This Docker image is an experimental toolkit gathering analyzers, detectors, packers, tools and machine learning machinery for making datasets of packed executables and training machine learning models for the static detection of executable packing applied to multiple formats (including PE, ELF and Mach-O) and for studying the best features that can be used in learning-based static detectors. Furthermore, it currently holds various functionalities to focus on supervised, unsupervised or even adversarial learning and is constantly being improved for extending its capabilities.",
