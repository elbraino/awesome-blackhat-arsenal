  "Description": "Passwords comprise one of the cornerstones of cybersecurity since the early ages, with a plethora of attacks focusing on secretly acquiring user's passwords. Password management software (PM) has been developed as a key weapon for counteracting such attacks. However, despite the various protections implemented by this kind of software, misconfigurations and user's mistakes may still lead to sensitive data leaks.\nIn this context, the current presentation details on a newly developed red teaming tool called Pandora (https://github.com/efchatz/pandora). Specifically, Pandora can acquire end-user's credentials from 18 well-known PM implementations, ranging from MS Windows 10 desktop applications to browser plugins. The only requirement for Pandora is for the PM to be up-and-running, enabling the tool to dump the PM's processes. In more detail, after the tool is executed in the host machine, it will dump the PM's processes, analyze them and extract any user credentials it finds.\nFor a methodological viewpoint, Pandora is based on each PM implementation. Basically, most PMs store their entries/master credentials in plaintext format within the corresponding memory processes. To this end, Pandora comprises different autonomous scripts based on each PM implementation.\nAfter following a CVD process, most vendors responded that such issues are out of their scope, since the attacker needs local access, or the AV/EDR may be able to impede such attacks. Overall, until now, only two vendors have acknowledged the problem and one has already reserved a CVE ID, namely CVE-2023-23349 (Kaspersky).",
