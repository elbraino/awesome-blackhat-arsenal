📝 **Description:** Event logs are a fundamental resource for security professionals seeking to understand the activity occurring in an environment. Cloud logs serve a similar purpose as their on-premise counterparts, though differing significantly in format and granularity between cloud providers. While most cloud CLI tools provide a one-to-one correlation between an API being invoked and a single corresponding API event being generated in cloud log telemetry, browser-based interactive console sessions differ profoundly across cloud providers in ways that obfuscate the original actions taken by the user.

For example, an interactive AWS console session produces 300+ CloudTrail events when a user clicks IAM->Users. These events are generated to support the numerous tiles and tables in the AWS console related to the user's clicked action but are never explicitly specified by the user (e.g. details concerning potential user groups, MFA devices, login profiles or access keys and their usage history for each IAM user in the paginated results). This backend behavior presents significant challenges for security analysts and tooling seeking to differentiate API calls explicitly invoked by a user from secondary API invocations merely supporting the AWS console UI.

Since March 2023 the presenters have developed a solution to this challenge and are proud to demo and release the open-source Cloud Console Cartographer framework (including a full CLI and supplemental GUI visualizer) as part of this presentation.

The presenters will demonstrate the extent of the console logging problem and the technical challenges and capabilities required to solve it, showcasing the tool's usefulness in translating real-world examples of malicious console sessions produced by notable cloud threat actors during first-hand incident response investigations.

Come and learn how the open-source Cloud Console Cartographer framework can provide clarity for threat hunters and detection engineers alike, helping defenders stop slogging through logging while putting the "soul" back in "console."

<details><summary><strong>Traceeshark - Interactive System Tracing & Runtime Security using eBPF</strong></summary>

![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Ofek Shaked](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ofek%20Shaked-informational) ![Asaf Eitani](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asaf%20Eitani-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Traceeshark brings the world of Linux runtime security monitoring and advanced system tracing to the familiar and ubiquitous network analysis tool Wireshark.

It is now possible, using Wireshark, to record an immense variety of system events using Aqua Security's eBPF based runtime security tool Tracee, and analyze them interactively.

Tracee is a runtime security and forensics tool for Linux, utilizing eBPF technology to trace systems and applications at runtime, analyze collected events to detect suspicious behavioral patterns, and capture forensics artifacts. Up until now, a typical workflow using Tracee involved running Tracee from the CLI, perform some activity, stop Tracee, dump its logs to a file, and analyze the file using command line tools or scripting languages. Analyzing packets captured by Tracee was done separately, and in general the entire process was very manual.

Now, events generated by Tracee can be analyzed interactively using Wireshark's advanced capabilities, which include interactive filtering, displaying statistics and performing advanced data aggregations. Traceeshark also provides the ability to capture events using Tracee directly from Wireshark and have them stream in like a network capture. Another game-changing feature is the ability to analyze system events side by side with network packets generated by Tracee that contain rich context about the system process and container they belong to.

The combination of Tracee's wide use in the security industry and its advanced system tracing and forensic capabilities, together with Wireshark's universal popularity in the entire IT industry, its maturity and ease of use, opens up a whole new world of capabilities for dynamic malware analysis, forensics, kernel hacking and more.

<details><summary><strong>VelLMes, a high-interaction AI based deception framework.</strong></summary>

![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Sebastian Garcia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sebastian%20Garcia-informational) ![Muris Sladic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Muris%20Sladic-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** VelLMes is the first free-software AI-based deception framework that can create digital-twins of Linux shells (SSH), SMTP, POP, HTTP and MYSQL protocols.

It is based on new deception research that uses fine-tuned and trained LLMs to create high-interaction honeypots that look exactly like your production servers. When attackers connect to a VelLMes SSH, they can not distinguish it from a real Linux shell. The LLM creates in real time, and depending on the commands of the attacker, the complete structure of the simulated computer, including file contents, output of all commands, connection to the Internet (simulated), users, and more.

VelLMes key features are:
The content from a previous session can be carried over to a new session to ensure consistency.
It uses a combination of techniques for prompt engineering, including chain-of-thought.
Uses prompts with precise instructions to address common LLM problems.
More creative file and directory names for Linux shells
In the Linux shell the users can "move" through folders
Response is correct also for non-commands for all services
It can simulate databases and their relations in the MySQL honeypot.
It can create emails with all the necessary header info in the POP3 honeypots.
It can respond to HTTP GET requests

VelLMes was evaluated and tested in its generative capabilities and deception capabilities with human penetration tester professionals to see if they can recognize the honeypot. Most attackers do not realize this is deception, and it performs much better than other deception technologies we have compared against.

VelLMes can bring a new perspective to your deception technology in your company.

<details><summary><strong>Analyzing Modern Windows Shellcode with SHAREM</strong></summary>

![Category: 🧠 Reverse Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🧠%20Reverse%20Engineering-orange) ![Bramwell Brizendine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bramwell%20Brizendine-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Analyzing Modern Windows Shellcode with SHAREM](https://github.com/Bw3ll/JOP_ROCKET)  
📝 **Description:** Shellcode is omnipresent, a constant part of the exploitation and malware ecosystem. Injected into process memory, there are limitless possibilities. Yet until recently, analysis techniques were severely lacking. We present SHAREM, an NSA-funded shellcode analysis framework with stunning capabilities that will revolutionize how we approach the analysis of shellcode.

SHAREM can emulate shellcode, identifying more than 25,000 WinAPI functions as well as 99% of Windows syscalls. This emulation data can also be ingested by its own custom disassembler, allowing for functions and parameters to be identified in the disassembly for the first time ever. The quality of disassembly produced by SHAREM is virtually flawless, markedly superior to what is produced by leading disassemblers. In comparison, IDA Pro or Ghidra might produce a vague "call edx," as opposed to identifying what specific function and parameters is being called, a highly non-trivial task when dealing with shellcode.

One obstacle with analyzing shellcode can be obfuscation, as an encoded shellcode may be a series of indecipherable bytes—a complete mystery. SHAREM can easily overcome this, presenting the fully decoded form in the disassembler, unlocking all its secrets. Without executing the shellocode, emulation can be used to help fully deobfuscate the shellcode. In short, a binary shellcode – or even the ASCII text representing a shellcode – could be taken and quickly analyzed, to discover its true, hidden functionality.

One game-changing innovation is complete code coverage. With SHAREM, we ensure that all code is executed, capturing function calls and arguments that might otherwise be impossible to get. This is done by taking a series of snapshots of memory and CPU register context; these are restored if a shellcode ends with unreached code. In practical terms, this means if a shellcode ordinarily would prematurely terminate, we might miss out several malicious functions. Complete code coverage allows us to rewind and restart at specific points we should not be able to reach, discovering all functionality.
SHAREM will now integrate AI to help resolve what exactly is going on. The enumerated APIs and parameters can be analyzed to identify malicious techniques, which could be found in MITRE ATT&CK framework and elsewhere. This helps reduce the human analysis effort required. Additionally,

SHAREM can use AI to rename functions based on functionality. AI is also used to provide detailed text descriptions of how each WinAPI or syscall is used within the shellcode, especially as it pertains to MITRE. There is much more to be seen with the new AI-enhanced capabilities.

The ease and simplicity of SHAREM is breathtaking, especially comparison to how much time and effort similar analysis would require otherwise. SHAREM represents a major shift in our capability to analyze shellcode in a highly efficient manner, documenting every possible clue – whether it be functions, parameters, secrets, or artifacts.

For reverse engineers of all kinds, SHAREM is a must-see presentation.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Recent years have witnessed the rise of cyber-attacks targeting Ethereum and EVM-based blockchains. Many of these attacks have involved the deployment of malicious EVM-compatible smart contracts to facilitate the hacks. One notable example is the use of "callee" smart contracts in flash loan attacks, which have resulted in substantial financial losses since early 2020. These malicious smart contracts are typically scripted in high-level languages (e.g., Solidity and Vyper), compiled into EVM bytecode, and deployed by bad actors without source code verification, making forensic analysis challenging.

To better understand the malicious smart contracts, EVM decompilers (e.g., EtherVM [1], Dedaub [2]) are commonly used by security researchers to convert EVM bytecode into high-level languages. However, the lack of interactive functionalities on existing decompilers makes comprehensive analysis difficult. Specifically, these tools do not allow for illustrating control flow graphs, adding comments, patching contract bytecode, and other interactive features. Notably, IDA Pro [3] and Ghidra [4], renowned for their robust interactive user interfaces and reverse engineering capabilities within the security research community, do not inherently support EVM. While plugins like the IDA EVM plugin [5] and Ghidra EVM plugin [6] have been developed to bridge this gap, they still have limitations, such as incomplete support for the 256-bit machine word size and limited decompilation capabilities.

We present Mothra, a Ghidra extension designed to address the aforementioned limitations. By integrating with Ghidra, Mothra facilitates the disassembly, CFG visualization, and decompilation of smart contracts. Moreover, Mothra analyzes EVM bytecode to uncover the internals of smart contract such as smart contract metadata, external functions, function signatures, and calling references of internal functions. This empowers Ghidra with enhanced functionality tailored for reverse engineering EVM-based smart contracts.

🔗 **Link:** [BugHog: A powerful framework for pinpointing bug lifecycles in web browsers](https://github.com/DistriNet/BugHog)  
📝 **Description:** BugHog is a comprehensive framework designed to identify the complete lifecycle of browser bugs, from the code change that introduced the bug to the code change that resolved the bug. For each bug's proof of concept (PoC) integrated in BugHog, the framework can perform automated and dynamic experiments using Chromium and Firefox revision binaries.

Each experiment is performed within a dedicated Docker container, ensuring the installation of all necessary dependencies, in which BugHog downloads the appropriate browser revision binary, and instructs the browser binary to navigate to the locally hosted PoC web page. Through observation of HTTP traffic, the framework determines whether the bug is successfully reproduced. Based on experiment results, BugHog can automatically bisect the browser's revision history to identify the exact revision or narrowed revision range in which the bug was introduced or fixed.

BugHog has already been proven to be a valuable asset in pinpointing the lifecycle of security bugs, such as Content Security Policy bugs.

📝 **Description:** Defenders and attackers often simplify vulnerabilities into '0-day' or '1-day' categories, neglecting the nuanced gray areas where attackers thrive. In this session, we'll explore critical flaws we've uncovered in the open-source vulnerability disclosure process and introduce our tool to detect open-source projects that are at risk from these flaws. We'll reveal how vulnerabilities can be exploited prior to receiving patches and official announcements, posing significant risks for users. Our comprehensive analysis of GitHub (including issues, pull requests, and commit messages) and NVD metadata will illuminate vulnerabilities that don't neatly fit into the conventional '0-day' or '1-day' classifications but instead fall into 'Half-Day' or '0.75-Day' periods – moments when vulnerabilities are known but not yet fully disclosed or patched. Furthermore, we'll spotlight the techniques employed to identify these vulnerabilities, showcasing various scenarios and vulnerabilities discovered through this method. During this session, we'll introduce an open-source tool designed to detect such vulnerabilities and emphasize the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit this information and develop exploits. Our objective is to aid practitioners in identifying and mitigating issues throughout their vulnerability disclosure lifecycle.

📝 **Description:** Who would have thought that asking LLMs to build bombs could enhance their security? Hold that thought. As these models become integral to our everyday digital tools—resembling a new operating system—they lack many of the security features we've come to expect. But here's where we turn the tables: understanding and disrupting their core alignments.

Our approach uses our deep experience as vulnerability researchers and applies zero-day research strategies to Generative AI. We've developed a systematic method to break into all the most updated LLM models and are excited to share our new open-source fuzzing infrastructure. This tool doesn't just jailbreak LLMs efficiently—it also helps us create detection-based solid solutions that improve LLM security.

🔗 **Link:** [MPT: Pentest In Action!](https://github.com/RohitLearner/Youtube_India_Data_Exploration/blob/master/preprocessedtest2019.csv)  
📝 **Description:** Security penetration testing is becoming as necessary and as usual a practice as software testing. Most, if not all, organisations either have their own penetration testing team or they utilise third-party pentesters.

Imagine any fast-paced organisation developing multiple product lines and planning to release each of them from time to time. It becomes challenging for the organisation's security team to efficiently manage all of these pentest activities running and effectively produce security assessment reports and track them.

Because of such volume of work, the numbers of pentesters in organisations are increasing to keep up. Each pentester is doing multiple pentests. The next cycle of a previous pentest can get assigned to another pentester. Each pentesting cycle has issues and recurring issues. And above all, managing all these using Excel worksheets is nightmare.

A pentesting activity knowledge base is kind of must. A single-pane-of-glass view to all pentests running, and the issues identified, is a necessity for everyone involved in the security review cycle.

To solve these challenges, I have developed a solution called Managing Pentest (MPT): Pentest in Action.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** **Shift left** means conducting security testing earlier in the software and application development phases. In traditional DevOps, the stages typically flow like this: Plan > Code > Build > Test > Deploy > Monitor.

Detecting critical security issues during the development phase is much more cost-effective since fixing vulnerabilities at later stages can be significantly more expensive. One approach to achieving this is through **source code analysis** using AI to detect vulnerabilities early. This includes monitoring whether new vulnerabilities are being introduced in pull requests.

At Akto, we have developed an open-source tool that can perform all the above in a shift-left manner. I have built this tool in the last one year and want to showcase it's capability.

Akto's source code scanning can detect:

- All the APIs currently defined in the source code
- All the parameters of those APIs
- The authentication mechanisms

This method allows for pinpointing the exact location where a security fix is needed and detecting any new vulnerabilities being added through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes.

This is my main project and I will love to present my work to audience at BlackHat.

📝 **Description:** Our faces are being scanned every day: to unlock phones, to establish KYC identity, and perhaps to board many flights. Truth be told, with great adoption comes even greater threats lurking. Since the dawn of facial recognition technology, many adversarial techniques to fool facial recognition models have come to their inception: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Deepfake, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and many more. The bad news is, to exploit facial recognition technology is no walk in the park. One must have both AI proficiency and hacking finesse to actually pull it off flawlessly.

But not with FaceGSM. As the name implies, FaceGSM utilizes the FGSM approach to create a subtle layer of semi-invincible pixels. When applied to an image of a person's face, this layer will make the model to misidentify the face as someone else.

What the name does not imply, however, is that you don't even need to know what an FGSM is to exploit a facial recognition model using FaceGSM framework. With just access to a facial recognition model and the target's face of your choice, FaceGSM will attempt to understand the construction of the model, apply image pre-processing accordingly, and then generate layers of perturbation pixels that could make a facial recognition model to misclassify your face into your target's face.

🔗 **Link:** [Morion - A Tool for Experimenting with Symbolic Execution on Real-World Binaries](https://github.com/cyber-defence-campus/morion)  
📝 **Description:** Morion (https://github.com/cyber-defence-campus/morion) is a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool to experiment with symbolic execution and to investigate the current limitations of this technique when applied to real-world binaries. Morion utilizes Triton (https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) as its underlying symbolic execution engine and operates in two distinct execution modes: (1) Tracing: Record concrete execution traces (concrete initial register/memory values, as well as a sequence of assembly instructions) of a target binary (optionally in a cross-platform remote setup). (2) Symbolic Execution: Analyze collected program traces by executing them symbolically.

Morion's modular design facilitates the seamless integration of custom symbolic analysis passes. It currently includes passes for detecting and analyzing control-flow and memory hijacking conditions, reasoning about code coverage, as well as assisting with the generation of ROP chains. Currently, Morion's implementation is restricted to ARMv7 binaries. However, the tool can be easily extended to support other architectures compatible with its underlying symbolic execution engine Triton.

🔗 **Link:** [Pandora: Exploit Password Management Software To Obtain Credential From Memory](https://github.com/efchatz/pandora)  
📝 **Description:** Passwords comprise one of the cornerstones of cybersecurity since the early ages, with a plethora of attacks focusing on secretly acquiring user's passwords. Password management software (PM) has been developed as a key weapon for counteracting such attacks. However, despite the various protections implemented by this kind of software, misconfigurations and user's mistakes may still lead to sensitive data leaks.
In this context, the current presentation details on a newly developed red teaming tool called Pandora (https://github.com/efchatz/pandora). Specifically, Pandora can acquire end-user's credentials from 18 well-known PM implementations, ranging from MS Windows 10 desktop applications to browser plugins. The only requirement for Pandora is for the PM to be up-and-running, enabling the tool to dump the PM's processes. In more detail, after the tool is executed in the host machine, it will dump the PM's processes, analyze them and extract any user credentials it finds.
For a methodological viewpoint, Pandora is based on each PM implementation. Basically, most PMs store their entries/master credentials in plaintext format within the corresponding memory processes. To this end, Pandora comprises different autonomous scripts based on each PM implementation.
After following a CVD process, most vendors responded that such issues are out of their scope, since the attacker needs local access, or the AV/EDR may be able to impede such attacks. Overall, until now, only two vendors have acknowledged the problem and one has already reserved a CVE ID, namely CVE-2023-23349 (Kaspersky).

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** The research field of vehicle cybersecurity has experienced a significant growth in interest due to the attack surface that the information systems comprising a vehicle provides and the ever-expanding body of regulations that provide special focus on cybersecurity on vehicular systems. Of particular interest is the attack surface exposed by OBD dongles, wireless devices that connect to the vehicle's diagnostic port, whose access to the vehicle's CAN buses could potentially be exploited by adversaries.

From an offensive security perspective, while it is possible to operationalize attacks in an ad-hoc manner, the resulting proof-of-concept programs may end constrained to a single vulnerable device model, further complicating scalable testing of the same vulnerability type against multiple devices; thus, extensible software frameworks can help the researcher develop and launch device-agnostic exploits, progressing towards operational implementations of attacks faster and more cost-effectively.

We reveal pwnobd, a Python-based offensive framework providing researchers with a common toolbox that allows for automation of simple attacks and provides assistance in the development of more complex attacks, deployable through an operator-ready command-line tool. A hardware demonstration platform will be provided on-site on the conference for the interested public to experiment with attacks that can be performed using this tool.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Silver SAML Forger is a tool developed to PoC SAML response forging, also known as Silver SAML and Golden SAML attacks, against applications federated to Entra ID for authentication using the SAML standard. The tool goes along with research into the vulnerabilities that can present in cloud identity providers, such as Entra ID, where if an attacker has access to the private key material Entra ID uses for SAML response signing, that the target applications may be susceptible to these forging attacks.

While Entra ID protects the private key if generated internally, as it cannot be exported, in the real-world organizations follow bad habits that may leave sensitive private key material available to an attacker. These sorts of habits have been observed by the research team that developed the Silver SAML Forger. Using this tool in combination with tools such as Burp Suite, you can demonstrate forging access to a target application. If the application supports certain types of SAML integrations, the identity provider will have no visibility into the authentication – you could think of these attacks as Kerberos Golden-ticket type attacks.

The tool requires the signing certificate to use, the username that is target for impersonation, and some basic federation information about the target application that can be derived from a few different methods.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Cloud security professionals today must understand the role policies play in access management for all identities in their organizations – humans and machines alike. However, calculating an identity's effective permissions is complex due to policy inheritance (e.g. managed policies inherited from groups, roles and Service Control Principal, each with their own potential inline policies). But is a firm grasp on permissions calculation sufficient?

Obfuscation of cloud policies, remote administration command scripts and various permissions parameters is an oft-overlooked attack vector with implications at several stages of the detection engineering pipeline. When "Allow" becomes "Al\u006Cow" and "iam:PassRole" becomes "iam:P*ole", are current detections evaded? Some obfuscation techniques are detectable in runtime events during creation but silently sanitized upon storage and/or later retrieval by corresponding APIs. Other techniques persist into the storage of created entities (e.g. IAM policies). These obfuscation scenarios can evade string-based detections, break policy rendering pages in Management Consoles, and even selectively overwrite policy contents of an attacker's choosing based on the defender's viewing method. Additionally, we identified subtle differences between official cloud provider tooling (CLI, SDKs, Management Console) that complicate the generation and detection of these obfuscation scenarios.

In this Arsenal session we will showcase obfuscation, deobfuscation, and detection scenarios using SkyScalpel – our brand new, fully custom open-source JSON tokenizer and syntax tree parser. SkyScalpel includes highly configurable randomized JSON-level obfuscation (Unicode encoding, insignificant whitespace packing, and selective special characters like \b and  ), policy-level obfuscation at the syntactical and functional levels (e.g., wildcard expansion of ActionNames), and deobfuscation and detection mechanisms for all aforementioned obfuscation capabilities.

Come see how SkyScalpel enables surgical precision in cloud offense and defense.

🔗 **Link:** [[X-Post] A Post Exploitation Toolkit for High Value Systems](https://github.com/doujiang-zheng/Awesome-Graph-Learning-Papers-List)  
📝 **Description:** The topic discussed the post-exploitation research on high-value systems such as email servers, gateway devices, documents, enterprise knowledge management and collaboration platforms, single sign-on platforms, defect tracking platforms, IT operations management software, domain management team building, code repository management, etc.Targeting various applications, it was achieved by deploying highly covert plugins and leveraging deprecated functionalities to hijack the runtime web container request processing logic and implant highly concealed persistent backdoors in memory. These memory-implanted backdoors serve as loaders to execute effective payloads directly in memory, with both the backdoor code logic and functional payloads operating within memory.

In-depth analysis of the code logic for different applications led to the exploration of solutions for challenges encountered during the runtime execution of payloads in memory. These challenges included multiple class loader loading, bypassing system file verification protection, and context decoupling for functional code extraction, among other issues.

The implementation enabled the execution of effective payloads in memory without initiating additional network requests to the target or writing files to disk. This allowed for the covert execution of payloads in memory under highly concealed attack scenarios, facilitating the extraction of high-value system information, such as email retrieval, plaintext password recording, operations data acquisition, obtaining arbitrary login credentials under unknown passwords, domain controller information retrieval, single sign-on hijacking, and trace cleaning operations.

Subsequently, existing web shell management tools were utilized to encrypt and transmit data, achieving traffic-side concealment. This approach aims to achieve a more comprehensive, covert, and long-term post-exploitation information gathering and deep penetration in real-world attack scenarios.
