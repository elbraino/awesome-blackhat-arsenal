  "Description": "HosTaGe is a lightweight, low-interaction, and portable honeypot for mobile devices that aims on the detection of malicious network environments. As most malware propagate over the network via specific protocols, a low-interaction honeypot located at a mobile device can check wireless networks for actively propagating malware. HosTaGe supports many commonly used protocols (e.g. HTTP, TELNET, SSH) along with many IoT/ICS specific ones (e.g. MQTT, S7COMM, MODBUS). We envision such honeypots running on all kinds of mobile devices to provide a quick assessment on the potential security state of a network.",
