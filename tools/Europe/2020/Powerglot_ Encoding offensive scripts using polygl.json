  "Description": "In red-team exercises or offensive tasks, masking of payloads is usually done by using steganography, especially to avoid network level protections, being one of the most common payloads scripts developed in powershell. Recent malware and APTs make use of some of these capabilities: APT32, APT37, Ursnif, Powload, LightNeuron/Turla, Platinum APT, Waterbug/Turla, Lokibot, The dukes (operation Ghost), Titanium, etc. But offensive tools based on steganography need a loader to run the payload. Powerglot tries to reduce this exposition using polyglots in several scenarios.\n\nPowerglot is a multifunctional and multi-platform attack and defense tool based on polyglots. Powerglot allows to mask a script (powershell, shellscripting, php, ...) mainly in a digital image, although other file formats are in progress. Unlike the usual offensive tools or malware, Powerglot does not need any loader to execute the \"information hidden\", minimizing the noise on the target system.\n\nPowerGlot has a clear utility in offensive tasks but it is also defined as a discovery and blue team tool. To our knowledge, it is the first general and complete open-source tool that allows to search for the presence of masked information with polyglots, information that could be useful to achieve persistence in a system or to hide malware (stego-malware, privilege escalation, lateral movement, reverse shell, etc.)",
