  "Description": "Tracee is a system tracing tool, focused on malware related behaviours.\n\nUsing eBPF technology of the Linux kernel, Tracee can trace selected system calls and internal kernel functions.\nOther than tracing, Tracee is also capable of capturing files written to disk or memory (e.g. \"fileless\" malwares), and extracting binaries that are dynamically loaded to an application's memory (e.g. when a malware uses a packer). With these features, it is possible to quickly gain insights about the running processes that previously required the use of dynamic analysis tools and special knowledge.",
