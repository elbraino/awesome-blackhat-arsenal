  "Description": "Git Wild Hunt is a tool that allows researchers and security operators to find leaked credentials and secrets in Github covering over 30 types of credentials. This tool is great for cloud security/DevOps security awareness or for cloud security pentesters and red teamers. We will show how deep into an organization or even personal sensitive information can be found by simply starting from leaked credentials in a GitHub project.",
