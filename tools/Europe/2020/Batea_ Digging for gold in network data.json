  "Description": "Batea is a simple tool that showcases how basic machine learning can help security analysts in their day-to-day operations. It is a context-driven network device ranking framework based on the anomaly detection family of machine learning algorithms. The goal of Batea is to allow security teams to automatically filter interesting network devices in large networks using nmap scan reports. We call those Gold Nuggets. Batea outputs the gold nuggets in order of interest for an attacker given the context of the network.\n\nThe human challenge is, on the one hand, that a typical enterprise network will host thousands of endpoints, far too many for a few security team members to constantly track and evaluate for their \"attractiveness\" to a potential intruder. On the other hand, the notion of interest is highly context-sensitive.\n\nBatea works by constructing a numerical representation of all devices from your nmap reports (XML) and then applying the Isolation Forest algorithm to uncover the gold nuggets. It is easily extendable by adding specific \"features\", or interesting characteristics, to the numerical representation of the network elements.\n\nThe features act as elements of intuition, and the unsupervised anomaly detection methods allow the context of the device, along with the total description of the network, to be used as the central building block of the ranking algorithm.\n\nGiven that we have taken meaningful elements of intuition all at once, the fact that the Isolation Forest algorithm always takes the whole dataset into consideration ensures that the network context is embedded in the ranking used to predict Gold Nuggets.\n\nPen testers can train the Batea machine learning model from scratch on new network data, or use a model that has been pre-trained on various networks.",
