  "Description": "One of the main benefits of cloud technology is to deploy quickly services, with minimum interaction from the administrator side, this is an advantage exploited by cyber criminals too. Nowadays the main threats all size companies are facing is phishing, every day cybercriminals are creating more sophisticated techniques to cheat users and make more difficult the job of blue teams. The most common technique used is typo squatting.\n\nPart of the Blue team mission is to detect phishing, typo squatters, and attack domains before the phishing campaign begins, there is outside plenty of tools trying to detect that domains based on DNS, however none of them are focus into the cloud.\n0365Squatting is a python tool created to identify that domains before the attack start. The tool can create a list of typo squatted domains based on the domain provided by the user and check all the domains against O365 infrastructure, (these domains will not appear on a DNS request).\n\nAt the same time, this tool can also be used by red teams and bug bunters, one of the classic attacks is the domain takeover so, the second option of this too is to check if the domain is registered in O365 in order to launch a domain takeover attack.",
