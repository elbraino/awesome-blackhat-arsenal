  "Description": "As we all know, many risks are involved with social networks such as impersonation, social-engineering, and data breach.\n\nTo demonstrate these attacks, we developed an innovative tool that can hijack and remotely control social network accounts by combining the powers of social engineering with malicious third party apps.\n\nWe built a private app store of phishing apps, with genres, that a bad actor can choose from to gain RAT control over victim accounts. To enable this, our tool manages oauth tokens within a single web console, allowing the hacker to exercise the functions of the victim accounts. To this end, we discuss other features and extensions of our tool, such as social engineering chat bots, crawlier bots, password crackers, and visualization tools for social network analytics.",
