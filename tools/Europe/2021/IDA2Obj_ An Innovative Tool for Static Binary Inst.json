  "Description": "As well known, object files are generated by c/c++ compiler or assembler from source code, and linked into an executable binary. But now, I can directly dump multiple object files just from one executable binary (exe, dll, ...) by using this tool. What's more amazing is that they can be linked again to a new binary, which is almost same as the old one !\n\nIt is designed mainly for SBI (Static Binary Instrumenation), to collect code coverage and integrate with popular fuzzing engines (AFL, honggfuzz, ...). Of course, it is faster than all of the DBI solutions.",
