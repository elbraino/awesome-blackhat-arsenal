  "Description": "In the development of software, the system is often designed on a good architecture to ensure the security of the system, which reduces the risk of being attacked. However, due to business requirements, some \"privilege rules\" often exist in some key security protection processes, such as some privilege userid lists, privilege url lists, or special paths, etc. These privilege configurations disrupt the original security process, and pull down the security level, become a new attack surface (intrusion into the original secure system through attack privilege rules). It is more difficult for us to attack the system directly, but it will be easier to attack the system through the vulnerabilities in the privilege rules, and even the vulnerabilities in these privilege rules already exist widely.\n\nBecause of the above attack risks, we develope a tool called \"privilege rules bug hunter\"(PBH) to detect the vulnerability of privilege rules in software. Data flow graph (DFG) and Control flow graph(CFG) enable us to better understand the inherent logic in software. However, there are so many control flows and data flows when identifying the privilege rules. How to distinguish the normal logic and find out the privilege rules accurately is a challenge. We will combine DFG, CFG and taint analysis methods to find out the risk: 1) generate a graph with the help of DFG and CFG , and use graph similarity information to classify. 2) The software is tested dynamically by online data, and the path information of runtime is recorded by hook to help identify the privilege paths of the graph in 1). 3) Collecting the information of privilege rules and looking for common vulnerabilities(such as xss etc) to reache the control of the whole system.\n\nIn this talk, we found the risk of privilege rules in a software , which broke the normal flow of software security architecture and introduce new risks. At the same time, based on the software analysis method, a tool is implemented to detect the vulnerability of privilege rules. We use the developed tool in Android Software Security testing, and find many privilege URLs and paths are configured into the software with high permissions. At the same time, there are a large number of n-days in the websites where these URLs exist.",
