  "Description": "Adventure of Dynamic Link Library (aDLL) is a console tool for the analysis of binaries and focused on the automatic detection of possible DLL Hijacking cases in Windows systems. The purpose of the tool is to analyse every DLL that an executable will load in memory, anticipating the Windows DLL search order and identifying those DLLs that are missing from the expected directory. That may lead in the replacement of the legitimate DLL by a malicious one if the directory has misconfigured permissions.",
