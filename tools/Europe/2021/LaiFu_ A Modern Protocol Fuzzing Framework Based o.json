  "Description": "As a protocol tester, we often use scapy to interact with the protocol because it is able to craft or decode packets easily and it implements a wide number of protocols. However, the fuzz function supported by scapy can not fuzz protocols sufficiently and effectively. Testers often need to write additional fuzzing code based on other fuzzing frameworks such as Peach and Boofuzz.\n\nAccording to the current situation, we design a protocol fuzzing tool named \"LaiFu\". LaiFu framework allows testers to use scapy to specify protocol formats directly. We designed the corresponding mutation algorithm according to the various field types of scapy's packet. Meanwhile, we also provide a tool to show the coverage of fuzzing target in real time. Testers only need to put each data packet as a node into the graph and then start the fuzzing test. Another advantage is that LaiFu makes many protocols already implemented by scapy to be fuzzable.\n\nWe are going to open source this tool to assist testers or developers to test their code and make protocol fuzzing easy and effective.",
