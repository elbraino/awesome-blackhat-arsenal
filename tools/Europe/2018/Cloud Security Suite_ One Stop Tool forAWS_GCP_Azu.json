  "Description": "While AWS, GCP & Azure provide protection with traditional security methodologies and have a neat structure for authorization/configuration, their security is as robust as the person in-charge of creating/assigning these configuration policies. As we all know, human error is inevitable and any such human mistake could lead to catastrophic damage to the environment.\n\nFew vulnerable scenarios:\n\nYour security groups/policies, password policy or IAM policies are not configured properly\nS3 buckets and Azure blobs are world-readable\nWeb servers supporting vulnerable ssl ciphers\nPorts exposed to public with vulnerable services running on them\nIf root credentials are used\nLogging or MFA is disabled\nAnd many more scenarios...\n\nKnowing all this, audit of cloud infrastructure becomes a hectic task! There are a few open source tools which help in cloud auditing but none of them have an exhaustive checklist. Also, collecting, setting up all the tools and looking at different result sets is a painful task. Moreover, while maintaining big infrastructures, system audit of server instances is a major task as well.\n\nCS Suite is a one stop tool for auditing the security posture of the AWS/GCP/Azure infrastructures and does OS audits as well. CS Suite leverages current open source tools capabilities and has custom checks added into one tool to rule them all.",
