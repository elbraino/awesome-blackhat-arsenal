  "Description": "Threat intelligence chat bots are useful friends. They perform research for you and can even be note takers or central aggregators of information. However, it seems like most organizations want to design their own bot in isolation and keep it internal. To counter this trend, our goal was to create a repeatable process using a completely free open source framework, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi (or even virtual machine), and host a community-driven plugin framework to open up the world of threat intel chat bots to everyone from the average home user to the largest security operations center.\n\nWe were thrilled to share the end result of our research (a chat bot that we affectionately call CyBot) with Black Hat attendees worldwide at the US, Europe, and Asia conferences. Each conference provided an opportunity to share the latest plugins and collect feedback and feature requests with the absolute best in the industry. This year's Black Hat Europe will allow us to continue the global collaboration effort in making incident response and threat research faster and more efficient than ever.\n\nBest of all, if you know even a little bit of Python, you can help our collaboration efforts by writing plugins and sharing them with the community. If you want to build your own CyBot, the instructions in this project will let you do so with about an hour of invested time and anywhere from $0-$35 in expenses. Come make your own threat intelligence chat bot today!",
