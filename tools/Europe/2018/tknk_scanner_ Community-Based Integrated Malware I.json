  "Description": "The original code of a malware must be scanned using YARA rules after processing with a debugger (or other means) to account for obfuscated malware binaries. This is a complicated process and requires an extensive malware analysis environment. The tknk_scanner is a community-based integrated malware identification system, which aims to easily identify malware families by automating this process using an integration of open source community-based tools and freeware. The original malware code can be scanned with with your own YARA rules by submitting the malware in PE format to the scanner. tknk_scanner can thus support surface analysis performed by SOC operators, CSIRT members, and malware analysts.",
