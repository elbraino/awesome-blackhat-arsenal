  "Description": "During our Trojans implantation research for IoT devices, we found many tools outdated and not compatible with high versions. We present IoT-Implant-Toolkit, a framework for Trojans implantation research of IoT devices. It is a toolkit consisting of essential software tools on firmware modification, serial port debugging, software analysis and stable spy clients. We wrapped tools we proved useable in the framework and provided a universal call interface. Additionally, we packed useful open-source tools we developed into the framework. Each software tool acts as a plugin which can be easily added into the framework. With an easy-to-use and extensible shell-like environment, IoT-Implant-Toolkit is a one-stop-shop toolkit simplifying complex procedure of IoT malware implantation.\n\nWith IoT-Implant-Toolkit, we were able to implant Trojans in eight devices with physical access, including smart speakers, cameras, driving recorders and mobile translators. We turned them into snooping devices, which send audios or videos in real time. Our presentation will also include live demos of those implanted devices.\n\nIoT-Implant-Toolkit is open-source at https://github.com/arthastang/IoT-Implant-Toolkit.",
