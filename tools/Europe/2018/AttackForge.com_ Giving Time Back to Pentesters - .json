  "Description": "Pentesters love what they do \u2013 breaking things. But there\u2019s no denying that Penetration Testing as a practice itself is broken. Pentesters have only few days to a) learn how an entirely new system works under the hood; b) with this knowledge, learn some more so they can figure out how to break the system; c) try countless different ways to break the system or make it do things never intended or designed by the architects and developers; then d) write an executive and technical report to explain how they did it.\n\nIt feels like an impossible task for the typical <1-week project, so why on earth would you want to become or remain a pentester? When you do this week-in week-out, add on top pressures from clients, organisational bureaucracy, worrying about utilisation, fighting Word formatting, or having to constantly justify your risk ratings \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder pentesters get burned out \u2013 fast!\n\nWe can\u2019t fix all of these problems, but we have found a way to take some pressure off pentesters and help make communication, collaboration, transparency and reporting much easier, and reduce some of the overheads wasted on trivial tasks which all are part of a pentest project\u2026 introducing AttackForge.com.",
