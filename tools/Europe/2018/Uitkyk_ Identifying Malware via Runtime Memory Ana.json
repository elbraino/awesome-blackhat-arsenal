  "Description": "Uitkyk is the first Android framework that allows for its implementers to identify Android malware according to the instantiated objects on the heap for a particular process. Uitkyk does not require the APK of the application to be scanned to be present to identify malicious behaviour but instead makes use of runtime memory analysis to detect behaviour which normally cannot be identified by static analysis of Android applications. Static analysis of Android applications is the default approach utilised to identify malicious applications however static analysis has certain shortcomings which Uitkyk addresses by targeting the heap. Uitkyk can be implemented as a standalone library or standalone application on mobile devices.",
