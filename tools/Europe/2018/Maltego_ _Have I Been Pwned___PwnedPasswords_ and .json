  "Description": "\u201cHave I been pwned?\" allows you to search across multiple data breaches to see if your email addresses or aliases has been compromised by LinkedIn, MySpace, Dropbox, etc.\n\n\"PwnedPasswords\" are half a billion real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts.\n\n\"FullContact\" allows you to enrich a Twitter username, location, person's name, company and alias or verify an e-mail address.\n\nMaltego is a link analysis application of technical infrastructure and/or social media networks from disparate sources of Open Source INTelligence (OSINT). Maltego is listed on the Top 10 Security Tools for Kali Linux by Network World and Top 125 Network Security Tools by the Nmap Project.\n\nThe integration of \"Have I been pwned?\u201d \"PwnedPasswords\" and \"FullContact\" with Maltego presents this data in an easy to understand graph format that can be enriched with other sources.\n\nRelease:\n\nMajor Update i.e. \"Have I Been Pwned?\"\nNew tool to be released at Black Hat i.e. \"FullContact\"",
