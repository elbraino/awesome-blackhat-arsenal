  "Description": "CrackQ is, first and foremost, a Python based queuing system for managing hash cracking using Hashcat. There are several tools available for this purpose, CrackQ was born from the frustration of using these tools on a daily basis. It adds some new and interesting additional features as solutions to these frustrations. CrackQ is essentially a REST API with clients in the form of a Python CLI tool and a web GUI. The API design is very stable and works very reliably as a platform to use for day-to-day password cracking within an offensive-security team. The tool is designed to be easy to install and comprises of currently 4 docker images, built on production ready containers segregating each component, all controlled seamlessly using docker-compose. The tool will also include detailed analysis/reporting with graphs representing a multitude of metrics and automated \"intelligent\" cracking using various pre-existing techniques and machine learning solutions. The tool will be released open-source in the coming months.",
