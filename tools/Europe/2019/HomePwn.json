  "Description": "The hyperconnected world is a reality nowadays. Today, we should consider that companies have a considerable number of these devices within their workplaces or offices. With the famous BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) companies are opening an attack vector that can be exposed or increased by the different devices that employees can carry to the office, either on their body, on a keyring, in their backpack or even on their clothes. The many different technologies that can be used are a vector attack for assailants and Red Team members.\n\nThe emergence of millions of devices, from different nature, have caused changes in the security applied for each of them. Using several technologies between these devices makes security heterogeneous. Bluetooth Low-Energy, WiFi, NFC are just some examples of the technologies being used by millions of devices around our society. Most of them can be found at home or in our offices.
