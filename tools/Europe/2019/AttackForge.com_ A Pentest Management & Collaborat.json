  "Description": "AttackForge.com is a free-to-use collaboration platform to manage pentesting projects. AttackForge allows a project team to easily collaborate in one place, reducing overheads and pain for all people involved - Customer, 3rd parties and Pentest Team. This is what makes AttackForge unique and different to other pentest collaboration solutions. It goes beyond automated reporting and issue library. It brings everyone together in one place and gives them tools and workflows to initiate & deliver a pentest, and also manage remediation testing.\n\nPentesters love to break things. However, they hate responding to unnecessary emails and phone calls; having to chase people for details to start testing; having to figure out who to talk to when things aren't working; and most of all having to write and review reports. AttackForge.com is purpose built to help pentesters focus their time and efforts on breaking things, and reduce distractions and unnecessary tasks. This helps to get the best out of the pentest team and provide better results for customers.\n\nAttackForge.com also helps people to start a career in penetration testing. AttackForge provides a secure online environment to create a portfolio of pentests to reflect skills, knowledge, and communication ability in an industry-standard way \u2013 to demonstrate to recruiters and future employers that they are ready for the workforce. This may also help to reduce the shortage of supply and skills-gap our industry is currently facing.",
