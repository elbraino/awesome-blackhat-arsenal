  "Description": "Addressing malware threats requires constant efforts to create and maintain a dataset. Especially, labeling malware samples is a vital part of shepherding a dataset. AVCLASS, a tool which takes as input VirusTotal reports and returns labels that aggregates scan results of multiple anti-viruses, is one of the most well-used oracles in both academia and industry.\n\nHowever, AVCLASS often suffers from the following drawbacks. First, AVCLASS is prone to fail labeling samples that have just been posted to VirusTotal because only a few anti-viruses give labels to such samples. An inconvenient truth: when we provided AVCLASS with 20,000 VirusTotal reports, half of them could not be labeled. Second, AVCLASS cannot determine if the label is randomly generated (as with domain generation algorithms of malware) or not. Some anti-viruses that VirusTotal has worked with after AVCLASS released were labeled with the DGA, resulting in a biased label. Because of them, we are forced to make a lot of manual, tedious intervention in malware labeling (otherwise, we need to drop samples with inconsistent labels from the dataset).\n\nIn this session, we present AVCLASS++, an open-source successor of AVCLASS. AVCLASS++ is carefully designed to address these drawbacks by arming with label propagation and DGA detection. We shall describe these techniques and demonstrate that AVCLASS++ can perform labeling more accurately than the vanilla one. Users of the vanilla AVCLASS can use AVCLASS ++ with the almost same command-line options as before. Even if you have never used AVCLASS, the use of AVCLASS++ is quite easy -- just prepare a malware sample and VirusTotal report, and give them as arguments. We envision that AVCLASS++ supports both practitioners (such as SOC operators, CSIRT members, and malware analysts) and academic researchers, and thus contributes to the further development of prompt security operation and reproducible security research.",
