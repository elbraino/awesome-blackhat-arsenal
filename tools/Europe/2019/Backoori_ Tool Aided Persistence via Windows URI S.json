  "Description": "The widespread adoption of custom URI protocols to launch specific Universal App can be diverted to nefarious purposes. The URI schemes in Windows 10 can be abused in such a way to maintain persistence via fileless technique. Backdooring a compromised user (Administrator privileges not required) is a matter of seconds. The attack is transparent to the unaware victim that won't be able to identify the attack and to the antivirus solutions that are currently not monitoring the specific Registry keys involved. These subtle fileless payloads can be triggered in many contexts, from the Narrator in the Windows logon screen (a novel Accessibility Feature abuse discovered by Giulio right before deciding to implement Backoori) to the classical web attack surface. The payloads can also be dropped in gadgets that can interact between each other by abusing, once again, the Windows URI protocols.",
