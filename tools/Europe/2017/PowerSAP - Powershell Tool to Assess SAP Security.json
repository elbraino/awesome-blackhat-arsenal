  "Description": "Most companies, small or big, use SAP technologies to work. Many of them provide access to their SAP environments through Citrix. Indeed, supplier or subcontractors need to reach SAP environment, from back office to boardroom, warehouse to storefront, desktop to mobile device; users can quickly and 'securely' access SAP enterprise application software with Citrix virtualization without exposing their SAP landscape to Internet.To pentest SAP system required some knowledge of this technologies and some hacking tool. Unfortunately, lots of SAP hacking tools are not maintained anymore and dependencies are required like RFC SDK to work. When it comes to assess/pentest the security of SAP landscape from Citrix, no tool is freely available and it is not allow or possible to install third softwares or dependencies.We present a compilation of powershell script to assess SAP, which try to answer to this problematic of dependencies and use from Citrix environment. The presentation will start by describing the issues around SAP hacking tools, then we will continue by explaining the restrictions meet to pentest from Citrix system. And then we will present in detail the tool developed to solve the issues meet and of course with some demos.",
