  "Description": "CERTitude is a Python-based tool which aims at assessing the compromised perimeter during incident response assignments. It allows analysts to perform large scale scans of Windows-based information systems by searching for behavioural patterns described in IOC (Indicator of Compromise) files.Notable features include:Ability to scan hosts in a way that prevents the target workstation from knowing what the investigator is searching forAbility to retrieve some pieces of data from the hostsMultiple scanner instances (for IOCs and/or hash scans) can be run at the same time for parallel scanningBuilt with security considerations in mind (protected database, secure communications with hosts using IPSec)",
