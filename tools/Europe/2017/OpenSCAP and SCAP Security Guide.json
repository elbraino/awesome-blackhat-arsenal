  "Description": "OpenSCAP is the only free and open source implementation of the NIST SCAP standard. It has two major use cases:Vulnerability assessment - enables users to automatically scan their machines for vulnerabilities using OVAL CVE feeds coming from the operating system vendors - Red Hat, Canonical, SUSE, ... OpenSCAP can load the CVE feed and examine the machine, virtual machine storage image or container. Any missing patches are reported.Security compliance - allows fully automated evaluation and remediation of machines using SCAP security policies. Instead of looking at vulnerabilities in this use-case we are looking for weaknesses in the configuration. A good source for SCAP security policies is the open source SCAP Security Guide project which we will demo with OpenSCAP. Check out the list of available products and profiles by visiting https://static.open-scap.org/Recently we have added new Ansible remediation capabilities to both OpenSCAP and SCAP Security Guide. Now it's possible to generate Ansible playbooks out of SCAP Security Guide profiles for all products. Furthermore we have improved container scanning and now support compliance profiles as well as CVE scans.",
