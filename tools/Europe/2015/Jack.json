Jack allows implementers to identify if certain online resources are vulnerable to ClickJacking and also allows implementers to generate a PoC to harvest submitted user credentials to illustrate the affect of the vulnerability. Jack also allows implementers to generate a local instance of the PoC site and deploy it a HTTP container such as Apache.",
