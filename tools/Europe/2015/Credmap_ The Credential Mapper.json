  "Description": "It is not uncommon for people who are not experts in security to reuse credentials on different websites; even security savvy people reuse credentials all the time. For this reason \"credmap: the Credential Mapper\" was created, to bring awareness to the dangers of credential reuse. Credmap takes a user and password as input and it attempts to login on a variety of known websites to test if the user has reused credentials on any of these. New websites can be easily added with simple knowledge of Python.Credmap is also capable of searching in public credential dumps of compromised websites (e.g. r0ckyou, AM, Adobe, etc.) and collecting the user's password from there to then test with on other websites. Credmap was written purely in Python and is open-source and available on GitHub.",
