  "Tool Name": "ROP ROCKET: Advanced ROP Automation for Exploitation",
  "Description": "ROP ROCKET is a groundbreaking, next-generation tool specifically designed for Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), boasting unparalleled capabilities. This tool introduces several innovative techniques, including a novel approach to invoking Heaven's Gate via ROP, seamlessly transitioning from x86 to x64 architectures, and invoking Windows syscalls directly via ROP to evade Data Execution Prevention (DEP), thus eliminating the reliance on less stealthy Windows API functions.\n\nThe focal point of this tool is automatic ROP chain generation—constructing complete ROP exploits. The tool introduces several groundbreaking ROP techniques, including both x86 and x64 Heaven's Gate and using Windows syscalls to bypass DEP. To overcome DEP, we automate chain generation for Windows syscalls NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. In addition, ROP ROCKET can avoid the need to bypass DEP by instead chaining multiple APIs together to achieve functionality more equivalent to traditional shellcode.",
