  "Tool Name": "Spikee: Simple Prompt Injection Kit for Evaluation and Exploitation",
  "Description": "Spikee is an open-source prompt injection testing toolkit for evaluating and exploiting LLM application security risks. Built from two years of real-world GenAI security assessments, it focuses on practical attack outcomes—data exfiltration, XSS, resource exhaustion—arising from the interaction between LLMs and their host applications, rather than typical content-generation harms.",
