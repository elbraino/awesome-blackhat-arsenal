  "Tool Name": "AnonyMask: Automated Masking and Unmasking of Explicit and Implicit Privacy Data",
  "Description": "AnonyMask is a privacy-preserving tool designed to automatically detect, mask, and unmask privacy data across various file formats. It allows enterprises to leverage the power of Large Language Model (LLM) or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) while ensuring that private or confidential information remains secure and compliant. With a single click, users can anonymize both explicit and implicit privacy data before sending it to LLM or RAG for analysis—and restore the original content afterward using smart unmasking. AnonyMask offers a secure, customizable, and offline-capable privacy-preserving document compatible with common file types such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .csv, and .txt.",
