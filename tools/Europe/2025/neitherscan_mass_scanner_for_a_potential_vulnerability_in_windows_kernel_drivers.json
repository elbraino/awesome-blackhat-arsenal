  "Tool Name": "NeitherScan: Mass Scanner for a Potential Vulnerability in Windows Kernel Drivers",
  "Description": "One way that user space applications in Windows interact with kernel drivers is via IOCTL. Applications and drivers pass data back and forth based on IOCTL code. When this code contains a flag METHOD_NEITHER, applications can pass any buffers for input and output directly to the kernel space. This flag could serve as a red flag for CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code). Related vulnerabilities have been found repeatedly.",
