  "Tool Name": "IOCTL-hammer - Parameter centric IOCTL Fuzzer for Windows Drivers",
  "Description": "IOCTL-hammer is a lightweight, Python-based fuzzing harness designed for efficient and targeted security auditing of Windows driver IOCTL interfaces. This tool addresses the high barrier to entry for kernel driver testing by providing a simple, accessible framework that focuses on the most common vulnerability patterns: buffer mismanagement. Rather than relying on complex, coverage-guided instrumentation, ioctl-hammer adopts a parameter-centric methodology, systematically manipulating the four core user-mode buffer descriptors sent via DeviceIoControl.",
