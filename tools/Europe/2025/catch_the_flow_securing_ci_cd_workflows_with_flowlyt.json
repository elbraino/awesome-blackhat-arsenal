  "Description": "In March 2025, a significant supply chain attack compromised the widely-used GitHub Action `tj-actions/changed-files`, affecting over 23,000 repositories. Attackers injected malicious code that exfiltrated secrets from CI/CD runners by dumping them into workflow logs, exposing sensitive credentials like GitHub Personal Access Tokens and private RSA keys. This incident, assigned CVE-2025-30066, underscored the vulnerabilities inherent in relying on third-party actions within CI/CD pipelines.",
