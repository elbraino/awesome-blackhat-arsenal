  "Tool Name": "Breaking the Tunnel: Real-Time API Interception in MDM-Locked Mobile Apps with KnoxSpy",
  "Description": "Mobile Device Management (MDM) applications, while crucial for organizational control, present a significant challenge for security professionals seeking to conduct thorough API testing. The enforced routing of all application traffic through centrally managed VPNs renders conventional interception proxies and system-level techniques ineffective. This limitation creates a critical gap in the security assessment of these privileged applications.",
