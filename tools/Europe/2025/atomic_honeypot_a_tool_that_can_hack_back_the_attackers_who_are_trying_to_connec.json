  "Tool Name": "Atomic Honeypot - A Tool That Can Hack Back the Attackers Who Are Trying to Connect to Your Database",
  "Description": "In 2023 we discovered a new vector - MySQL server can attack client and presented it at HitB in Amstedam (https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2023ams/session/how-mysql-servers-can-attack-you/). Later on we have discovered 2 new CVEs in MySQL client libraries and tools, including backup tools. That allowed us to create a new tool, Atomic Honeypot, which targets attackers who are trying to delete your MySQL database. The Atomic Honeypot was first presented at Defcon 2024 (PDF). Since then we found additional CVEs in both MySQL and PostgreSQL and adapted the tool to work with PostgreSQL backup tools (pg_dump, pg_restore), allowing us to explore more PostgreSQL database attacks as well as attacking back the attackers.",
