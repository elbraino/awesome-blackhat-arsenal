  "Tool Name": "Securing Secrets from Dev Machine to Deployments Using SLV",
  "Description": "SLV (Secure Local Vault) bridges the gap between local developer environments and secure CI/CD pipelines by offering a lightweight, CLI-first tool for managing secrets without relying on centralized, cloud-hosted secrets managers. This talk will demonstrate how sensitive credentials can leak across development to production workflows and how SLV prevents this through isolated, encrypted vaults, ephemeral secrets injection, and audit-friendly flows. With real-world attack paths as context, we will show how SLV hardens secrets handling from the first line of code to final deployment.",
