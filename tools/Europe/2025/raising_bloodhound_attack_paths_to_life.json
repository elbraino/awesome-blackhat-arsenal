  "Tool Name": "Raising BloodHound Attack Paths to Life",
  "Description": "Security practitioners rely heavily on lab environments to test tools, techniques, and exploits before bringing them into live environments. But most labs are built with generic setups, such as one domain and a couple of workstations, and rarely capture the tangled complexity of real-world Active Directory: multiple domains, nested groups, delegated permissions, misconfigured ACLs, and privilege escalation paths that only exist through deep object relationships",
