  "Tool Name": "Virga: Local LLM Embedded C2 Framework",
  "Description": "Virga is a new cross-platform command & control (C2) framework powered by a local large language model (LLM). This framework can generate a beacon implant with an embedded LLM, and perform autonomous post-exploitation actions on a target system. In other words, the embedded LLM model autonomously generates and executes the appropriate command based on the situation. Additionally, each beacon has an in-memory database (MemDB) in which the command results are saved in order to improve subsequent actions.",
