  "Tool Name": "Project Foxhound",
  "Description": "The web has seen a paradigm shift in recent years, from on-premise, monolithic server applications, to collections of cloud-based microservices. As such, much of the application logic has shifted from the server to the client, with program logic running on a user's browser. This shift has brought with it a new class of client-side web vulnerabilities, the most prominent being client-side (or DOM-based) cross-site scripting (XSS). Most state-of-the-art tools, however, are still focused on detection of their server-side counterparts (such as reflected XSS). Hunting for client-side issues, remains a manual effort, requiring time-intensive and costly penetration tests.",
