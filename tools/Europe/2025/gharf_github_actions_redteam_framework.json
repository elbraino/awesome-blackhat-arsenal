  "Tool Name": "GHARF: GitHub Actions RedTeam Framework",
  "Description": "In recent years, Red Team exercises have become increasingly important. However, the processes involved - such as developing attack scenarios, preparing tools, and building execution environments - require significant time and effort. These burdens have become major obstacles that limit both the frequency and quality of such exercises.\nTo address these challenges, we have developed a groundbreaking framework called GHARF, which applies the principles of Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to Red Team operations, enabling more efficient execution of exercises.",
