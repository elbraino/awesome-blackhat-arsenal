  "Tool Name": "EMFIF2 - Electro Magnetic Fault Injection Fuzzing Framework",
  "Description": "EMFIF2 (Electro Magnetic Fault Injection Fuzzing Framework) automates hardware fault injection attacks using CNC-positioned electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generators. It provides a modular, scriptable approach to fuzzing embedded systems through targeted EM glitching, enabling researchers to discover hardware vulnerabilities with minimal manual intervention and observe device fault responses in real-time.",
