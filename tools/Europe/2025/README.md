🔗 **Link:** [NeitherScan: Mass Scanner for a Potential Vulnerability in Windows Kernel Drivers](https://github.com/DisAsterGroup/NeitherScan)  
📝 **Description:** NeitherScan is a mass scanner for identifying Windows kernel drivers that use the METHOD_NEITHER I/O control flag, which allows user-space applications to pass arbitrary buffers directly to kernel space. This flag is a known indicator for CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER), enabling rapid discovery of potentially vulnerable drivers at scale.
