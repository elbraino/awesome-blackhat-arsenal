  "Tool Name": "ReForge: Where Crashes Become Weapons",
  "Description": "ReForge is an AI-powered pipeline that takes binary crash artefacts from AFL++ and automatically forges them into working proof-of-concept exploits; complete with human-readable analysis reports. Under the hood, it integrates a multi-agent system: a cloud-based LLM generates the exploit, a local custom-AI model explains it, and a lightweight coordinator (MCP) manages validation and retry logic. Each exploit is auto-tested against an un-instrumented target binary before being stored with metadata and analysis, making the results immediately actionable.",
