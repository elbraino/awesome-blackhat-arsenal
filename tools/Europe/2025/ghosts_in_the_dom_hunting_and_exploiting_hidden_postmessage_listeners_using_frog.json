  "Tool Name": "Ghosts in the DOM: Hunting and Exploiting Hidden postMessage Listeners Using FrogPost Extension",
  "Description": "FrogPost is a browser extension for advanced postMessage security analysis. It dynamically discovers event handlers and performs AST-based static analysis to track data taint, identify common sinks (like eval or innerHTML), and crucially, extract the conditional logic (e.g., if (event.data.type === 'chat')) that guards these sinks.",
