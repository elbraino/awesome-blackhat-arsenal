  "Tool Name": "Golden dMSA: One Key to Rule Them All",
  "Description": "Golden dMSA is a post-exploitation tool that exploits vulnerabilities in Active Directory Managed Service Accounts to escalate privileges across an entire forest. By compromising a single domain, it obtains Kerberos tickets and derives passwords for all dMSAs and gMSAs, bypassing security restrictions that normally prevent non-privileged users from enumerating these protected accounts.",
