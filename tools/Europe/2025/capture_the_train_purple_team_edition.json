  "Tool Name": "Capture the Train: Purple Team Edition!",
  "Description": "Monitoring is often seen as a silver bullet for ICS security—but how effective is it really? In this Arsenal demo lab, you'll launch real attacks against an industrial setup composed of PLCs and SCADA controlling a model train and robotic arms. We'll assess which attacks are detected (or not!), leveraging two newly released plugins we developed to add more ICS capabilities to MITRE CALDERA: caldera-s7 and caldera-opcua.",
